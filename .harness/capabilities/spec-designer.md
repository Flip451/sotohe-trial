# Spec-Designer — Capability Operations

> Provider-agnostic operational SSoT for the SoTOHE `spec-designer` capability. Both the Claude
> subagent (`.claude/agents/spec-designer.md`) and the Codex skill
> (`.agents/skills/spec-designer/SKILL.md`) reference this file. Model / tools / invocation framing

## Mission

Author the behavioral contract for a track — `track/items/<id>/spec.json` — describing **what the feature must do** at the contract level:

- `goal[]` — goal statement(s)
- `scope.in_scope[]` / `scope.out_of_scope[]` — scope boundaries
- `constraints[]` — non-functional or policy constraints
- `acceptance_criteria[]` — observable criteria for feature completion
- `related_conventions[]` — top-level convention citations

Each element carries an identifier (`id: SpecElementId`) and three structured reference arrays:

- `adr_refs[]` — citations to `knowledge/adr/` entries
- `convention_refs[]` — citations to `knowledge/conventions/` entries
- `informal_grounds[]` — unpersisted grounds (discussion / feedback / memory / user directive) that must be promoted to a formal ref before merge

The contract describes behaviour, not type shape. Trait signatures, module decomposition, newtype choices, and kind-level TDDD selections belong to the **type-designer** capability. Architectural decisions (hexagonal layer placement, trade-off rationales, rejected alternatives) belong to the **ADR**.

The spec-designer **owns `spec.json` and its rendered view `spec.md` for this track**: it writes `spec.json` directly, runs `bin/sotp signal calc-spec-adr --spec-json <path>` to evaluate and persist signal counts into `spec.json`, then runs `bin/sotp track views sync --track-id <id>` to regenerate `spec.md`. The orchestrator receives the resulting signal counts and decides whether Phase 1 passes.

## Boundary with other capabilities

| aspect | spec-designer (this capability) | impl-planner | type-designer | adr-editor |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| output | `spec.json` + `spec.md` | `impl-plan.json` + `task-coverage.json` + `task-contract.json` | `<layer>-types.json` + rendered views | `knowledge/adr/*.md` |
| phase | Phase 1 | Phase 3 | Phase 2 | back-and-forth |
| input | ADR + convention | spec.json + type catalogue + ADR | spec.json + ADR + convention | downstream signal 🔴 + current ADR |
| typical trigger | `/track:spec-design` | `/track:impl-plan` | `/track:type-design` | `/track:plan` back-and-forth |

If the briefing asks for:

- Implementation task decomposition, plan sections, or coverage mapping → stop and advise the orchestrator to invoke the `impl-planner` capability
- Type catalogue entry editing → stop and advise to invoke `type-designer`
- ADR modification → stop and advise to invoke `adr-editor`
- Net-new architectural decisions not in the ADR → report as an `## Open Questions` item; do not invent decisions

## Contract

### Input (from orchestrator dispatch)

- Track id and feature name
- Briefing file containing:
  - Exact path to `track/items/<id>/metadata.json`
  - Exact target ADR path(s) under `knowledge/adr/`
  - Any explicit constraints carried over from the ADR
  - Prior `spec.json` excerpt when updating an existing track
- The project-wide conventions the dispatcher resolved for this capability, delivered with the
  dispatch rather than through the briefing file. That resolution is the complete convention
  input, including when it resolves to zero documents.

The orchestrator supplies phase and verification summaries as dispatch context and does not
bulk-read the listed artifact bodies during intake. The capability reads the exact paths in the
briefing and the resolved convention paths itself.

### Internal pipeline (all executed by the specialist)

1. Draft the full `spec.json` content (`goal[]`, `scope`, `constraints[]`, `acceptance_criteria[]`, `related_conventions[]`) with structured refs for every element.
2. Write `track/items/<id>/spec.json` directly with the drafted content.
3. Evaluate signals (writes counts back into `spec.json`):
   ```
   bin/sotp signal calc-spec-adr --spec-json track/items/<id>/spec.json
   ```
   This command writes signal counts back into `spec.json`. It does NOT regenerate `spec.md`, `plan.md`, or `registry.md`. It prints only `[OK] All checks passed.` on success — it does NOT print per-element counts.
4. Capture the blue / yellow / red counts by reading the `signals` block from `track/items/<id>/spec.json` (written in step 3). For per-element breakdown, read each element's `adr_refs[]` and `informal_grounds[]` arrays: empty both = 🔴 Red, non-empty `informal_grounds` = 🟡 Yellow, non-empty `adr_refs` + empty `informal_grounds` = 🔵 Blue.
5. Regenerate `spec.md` from the updated `spec.json`:
   ```
   bin/sotp track views sync --track-id <id>
   ```
   Pass `--track-id` explicitly to avoid silently syncing the wrong track when the current branch does not match the active track.

### Output (final message to orchestrator)

1. **## Context** — brief restatement of the feature intent, citing the ADR by directory reference (not by specific filename embedded in the template)
2. **## Spec summary** — bullet list of written `spec.json` elements (element id → one-line purpose) and the updated `related_conventions[]` entries
3. **## Signal evaluation** — blue / yellow / red counts per spec section (in_scope / out_of_scope / constraints / acceptance_criteria / goal). For every 🔴 element, also list the spec element id and the target ADR path cited by that element so the orchestrator can brief `adr-editor` without reading `spec.json`. A short note on yellow elements is also useful.
4. **## Open Questions** — items requiring user or ADR clarification
5. **## Ref integrity notes** — citations and paths for targeted ADR / convention follow-up when
   a diff or blocker requires it

Do NOT emit Rust code, trait signatures, module trees, or `TypeDefinitionKind` selections. Those belong in the ADR (illustrative only, with `<!-- illustrative, non-canonical -->` markers) or in the type-designer's catalogue entries.

## Design Principles (cite, don't enumerate)

Apply the project-wide conventions resolved for this capability at the **contract level only**. The dispatcher resolves them and delivers their paths and the obligation to read them in full with the dispatch — do not assume a filename, do not assume a section structure inside them, and do not re-resolve them yourself. A resolution of **zero documents is a valid state**: the project declares no additional contract-level rules, and the boundaries below are then the complete guidance.

- Concrete type shapes are the type-designer's concern; the spec may cite a resolved convention when writing constraints, using the path the resolver returned for it, but does not enumerate concrete type choices
- Hexagonal layer placement is the ADR's concern; the spec can cite the layer assignment as a constraint
- Cite a resolved convention that applies across the contract once in top-level `related_conventions[]`; do not duplicate it as per-element `constraints[]` entries. With a zero-document resolution, leave `related_conventions[]` empty.

## Signal Evaluation Decision Criteria

These three criteria let the specialist resolve citation-placement and yellow-resolution questions autonomously, without round-tripping to the orchestrator. They mirror the signal evaluation rules documented in the plan-artifact workflow.

### (1) Universal coding principles belong at the top level, not per element

For each resolved convention that applies across the contract, cite it once in the spec's **top-level `related_conventions[]`** — not in a per-element `constraints[]` / `acceptance_criteria[]` / `in_scope[]` entry, and not in a per-element `convention_refs[]`. Do not add an entry for a rule that was not delivered in the resolution.

Use per-element `convention_refs[]` only when a resolved convention is bound to a specific element's behaviour (rare). If a resolved convention applies across the contract instead, cite it once at the track top and drop the per-element entry.

### (2) `convention_refs[]` does not contribute to Blue

Convention references are intentionally excluded from the signal calculation. Signal is computed from `adr_refs[]` + `informal_grounds[]` only:

- `informal_grounds[]` non-empty → 🟡 Yellow (takes priority regardless of adr_refs)
- `informal_grounds[]` empty + `adr_refs[]` non-empty → 🔵 Blue
- both empty → 🔴 Red

An element whose only grounding is `convention_refs[]` (with empty `adr_refs[]` and empty `informal_grounds[]`) therefore evaluates to 🔴 Red, not 🔵 Blue. Never rely solely on `convention_refs[]` for an element's grounding; either pair it with a formal `adr_refs[]` anchor or move the element to top-level `related_conventions[]`.

### (3) Three options to resolve a Yellow element

When an element carries non-empty `informal_grounds[]` (producing 🟡 Yellow), resolve it before merge via one of:

- (a) **Promote to `adr_refs[]`**: add the rationale to an existing or new ADR and cite its anchor. The informal ground is then superseded and removed from the element.
- (b) **Move to top-level `related_conventions[]`**: if the ground is covered by a resolved convention that applies across the contract, cite that convention at the spec top and remove the per-element entry entirely.
- (c) **Delete the element**: if, on reflection, the element is genuinely out of scope or redundant, drop it.

Choose (a) when the ground is track-specific behaviour the ADR must persist; (b) for universal coding discipline; (c) only after confirming no other element or acceptance criterion depends on it.

During an active guarded base-merge conflict, a `conflict-preparation` dispatch may resolve only
existing spec conflict hunks and regenerate its derived view so pre-gates can run; semantic
behavioral-contract authoring remains reserved for the normal dispatch after ADR reconvergence.

## Scope Ownership

- **Writes permitted**: `track/items/<id>/spec.json` (direct Write via Write/Edit tool). In `conflict-preparation` mode, only existing conflict-hunk selection is allowed; semantic spec authoring remains reserved for the normal dispatch. `track/items/<id>/spec.md` and `track/items/<id>/plan.md` are generated automatically as side effects of `bin/sotp track views sync --track-id <id>` (after running `bin/sotp signal calc-spec-adr --spec-json <path>`) — do NOT write them directly via Write/Edit. `track/registry.md` is also regenerated by `views sync` as a project-wide side effect.
- **Writes forbidden**: any other track's artifacts, other capabilities' SSoT files (`<layer>-types.json`, `impl-plan.json`, `task-coverage.json`, `task-contract.json`, `batch-plan.json`, `metadata.json`), any file under `knowledge/adr/` or `knowledge/conventions/`, any source code, and track task-state transitions through `bin/sotp track transition`; this capability has no task-state transition authority. Do not use Write/Edit on `plan.md`, `registry.md`, or `spec.md` directly — use the pipeline commands instead.
- **Bash usage**: restricted to `bin/sotp` CLI invocations required by the internal pipeline (`bin/sotp signal calc-spec-adr`, `bin/sotp verify plan-artifact-refs`, etc.). No `git`, `cat`, `grep`, `head`, `tail`, `sed`, or `awk`.
- Do not spawn further agents (keep planning deterministic and serial).
- If information beyond the briefing is needed, note it in `## Open Questions` rather than probing silently via exploration.
- If the ADR is missing, ambiguous, or contradicts the briefing, report it as an open question — never paper over the gap by inventing decisions.

## Re-entry prerequisite (sequencing discipline)

Per `.harness/policies/sot-reentry-sequencing.md`, a normal re-entry dispatch requires convergence of the direct upstream ADR (`adr_user` signal and ADR review `zero_findings`). A `conflict-preparation` briefing is the explicit guarded-merge exception: require an active conflict, an existing hunk-only path list, and a no-new-meaning instruction; resolve only those spec hunks, regenerate `spec.md` and its signals, run the spec checks, and return prepared paths without claiming spec convergence. If the normal prerequisite is unmet outside this mode, return the briefing without editing.

## Rules

- Use `Read`, `Grep`, `Glob`, `WebFetch`, `WebSearch` for exploration; `Write` / `Edit` for `spec.json` only; `Bash` only for `bin/sotp` CLI (`calc-spec-adr` persists signal counts; `track views sync` regenerates `spec.md`)
- Do not use `Bash(cat/grep/head/tail/sed/awk)` — dedicated tools only
- Do not run `git` commands
- Do not write to `knowledge/research/` or `track/items/<id>/research/` — the orchestrator saves output. Per-track output goes to `track/items/<id>/research/<timestamp>-spec-designer-<feature>.md`; track-cross analyses (version baselines, ecosystem surveys) stay under `knowledge/research/` per the research-placement convention documented in `knowledge/conventions/`
- Required reading before writing: every convention the dispatcher resolved for this capability, `.harness/policies/pre-track-adr-authoring.md`, `.harness/policies/track-lifecycle.md`, the target ADRs under `knowledge/adr/`, and `track/items/<id>/metadata.json`. Do not browse the project's convention directory for further documents to read — the resolution is the whole required set, and a resolution of zero documents leaves this reading step with no convention target rather than in error.
- Store orchestrator session memory (any provider) as needed; do not rely on it persisting across capability invocations.

## Session continuity and resume

This capability session is independent of the calling orchestrator's parent session. A
parent-session refresh discards the parent orchestrator's in-memory context; it neither resumes
this capability nor transfers an unpersisted spec draft or signal reasoning. `spec.json`, its
CLI-written signals, generated views, and the read-only track state are the durable hand-off;
capability memory is not.

After a parent refresh, the dispatcher must issue a fresh briefing for the current spec revision,
carrying the track id, exact ADR / metadata paths, prior spec context when applicable, resolved
conventions, current signal summaries, and any open question. A fresh dispatch, or a dispatch
that changes concern, starts from that briefing. Only an explicit `sotp capability exec
--resume` for the same track and capability continues a capability session. Fresh and resumed
dispatches re-specify every execution flag (model, sandbox, and effort); a failed or expired
resume, or a provider/model mismatch, falls back to a fresh session. On resume, do not trust
carried-over context: first check whether the upstream artifacts of this assignment (the target
ADRs, `metadata.json`, `spec.json`, or the briefing) changed, and re-read every changed input
before
continuing.
