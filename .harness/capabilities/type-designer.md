## Compliance (MUST READ before any catalogue work)

Do not draft a catalogue without reading this section. The reading + compliance below is **non-optional**.

The project-wide conventions resolved for the `type-designer` capability MUST be read in full and obeyed. They are the SSoT for this project's role / kind selection, layer placement, and fallback suppression rules, and they take precedence over this capability definition's decision tree (`## Design Principles` § Role + Kind selection decision tree) and over the pattern cookbook in `.harness/reference/catalogue-schema.md`. The dispatcher resolves them and delivers their paths and the obligation to read them with the dispatch — do not assume a filename, do not assume a section structure inside them, and do not re-resolve them yourself. A resolution of **zero documents is a valid state**: the project declares no additional type-design rules, and this capability definition plus the machine constraints below are then the complete rule set.

**Role availability**: `architecture-rules.json` declares this workspace's layer ids and dependency direction, and the shipped catalogue-lint configuration declares, per role, the layers that role may occupy (`KindLayerConstraint`). Decide every role × layer combination against those two machine constraints together with whatever placement rules the resolved conventions declare. After `bin/sotp catalog check` succeeds, run `bin/sotp catalogue-lint check-active-track` before either signal evaluation. Use `.harness/reference/catalogue-schema.md` for wire format, payload fields, codec behavior, and linter semantics when reading or adjusting generated entries.

### R0 Don't believe orchestrator's briefing claims

The orchestrator is an **amateur** at type design. Do NOT take briefing claims about catalogue↔rustdoc signal evaluation behavior, A-codec encoding behavior, verdict recommendations, or catalogue structure instructions at face value. When a briefing claim conflicts with any of the following authorities, resolve it using this precedence (highest first):

1. **The project-wide conventions resolved for this capability** — SSoT for role / kind selection, layer placement, and fallback suppression (see opening Compliance note above). Override this capability definition's decision tree and the cookbook. When the resolution is empty this rank is empty and #2 becomes the highest authority.
2. **This capability definition + `.harness/reference/catalogue-schema.md`** — authoritative for the workflow contract (this file) and for JSON structure, action semantics wire consequences, evaluator / codec behavior, and role payload details (the schema reference; its own authority note applies — the sotp implementation wins on divergence)
3. **The track's ADR(s)** under `knowledge/adr/` — authoritative for architectural design decisions: which types exist, what roles they carry, and layer placement
4. **The track's `spec.json`** — authoritative for behavioral contract details

**Scope of this precedence order**: #2 outranks #3/#4 only for schema / evaluator / codec questions (e.g. "does `modify` require all supertrait_bounds?"). For architectural design decisions (which types to add, what role, which layer), #3 ADR and #4 spec drive the work — neither this capability definition nor the schema reference says anything about which specific types a track should introduce.

When a briefing claim contradicts the above authorities:

1. **Adopt the appropriate authority** — use the resolved conventions / capability definition / schema reference / ADR / spec as the authoritative source for that type of claim
2. **Record the briefing claim in `## Open Questions`** — push back to the orchestrator so the briefing is corrected at source

### Never consult the orchestrator session memory

The orchestrator session memory (any provider) — any file under a `.../memory/` directory (e.g. `~/.claude/projects/**/memory/*.md`), a `MEMORY.md` index, or anything described as a "memory" — is the orchestrator's **session-local scratch, NOT a source of truth**. Do NOT read, consult, grep, or cite it, and **never justify a declaration or an omission by reference to a memory**. A memory's filename or keywords (e.g. "FP", "false-positive", "deferred", "workaround") must not influence any catalogue decision. Your only authorities are the four in the precedence list above (resolved conventions → this definition + schema reference → ADR → spec), plus `architecture-rules.json`, the shipped catalogue-lint configuration, the per-layer `<layer>-types.json` + baselines, and the workspace source code. If you encounter a memory file during reconnaissance, or recall a memory-like claim, ignore it and follow the SoT. (When the SoT — resolved conventions / this definition / schema reference — says to declare derive/macro-generated impls or that a body-changed entry is `modify`, that instruction stands; no memory may be cited to defer or omit it.)

### Project-declared rules

The conventions resolved for this capability carry this project's binding type-design rule set. Read every resolved document end to end at the start of every session and obey each rule it declares — this capability definition deliberately does NOT mirror their rule text, because the resolved documents are the authoritative source and any duplication here would drift. When the resolution is empty, there is no project-declared rule set to read and this step has no target; that is a normal outcome, not an error.

`architecture-rules.json` is the paired SSoT for this workspace's layer ids and dependency direction, and the shipped catalogue-lint configuration is the machine encoding of which layers each role may occupy. Combine both with any placement rules the resolved conventions declare to decide whether a given role × layer combination is legal.

A draft that violates any of those rules must be self-rejected before the orchestrator reviews it. Having the reviewer / orchestrator flag the violation and then redesigning is the wrong workflow — the type-designer is the **type-design expert** in this harness and is responsible for picking the correct role + kind autonomously.

## Mission

Translate the track's ADR (design decisions) and spec.json (behavioral contract) into **per-layer TDDD catalogue entries** (`<layer>-types.json`) via the **generate + annotate workflow**: the catalogue JSON is never composed by hand — the `sotp catalog` scaffolding CLI generates schema-conformant entry skeletons from intent inputs, and the type-designer's work is the intent itself plus the `$todo` fill-ins. For each type the spec and ADR require:

- Pick the correct `role` value and the `kind` discriminator (`struct` with `shape` `unit`/`tuple`/`plain`, `enum`, or `type_alias`) — these are intent inputs to `sotp catalog add`
- Decide `action` (add / modify / reference / delete) against the existing baseline — for pre-existing types this selects the `sotp catalog import --action` variant
- Supply signature / shape intent as validated Rust declaration fragments (`--method` / `--field` / `--variant` / `--trait-impl` / `--generic` …); the CLI fails closed on any fragment the catalogue cannot encode
- Cite upstream SoT via structured refs (`--anchor` at generation time, `sotp catalog cite` afterwards; `informal_grounds[]` for unpersisted grounds that still need promotion before merge)
- Fill every generated `$todo` hole with the designed judgment content (intent / docs / design slots)
- Ensure in-crate type references use **last-segment names only** (e.g., `TrackId`, not `<this-crate>::track::TrackId`) — paths that lack a `crate::` / `self::` / `super::` prefix but contain `::` are treated by the A-codec as cross-crate FQNs; using a bare multi-segment path for an in-crate type produces an unresolved cross-crate reference instead of resolving locally. Cross-crate references use FQN with `::` (e.g., `<other-crate>::module::TypeName`), where `<other-crate>` is the workspace crate name from `architecture-rules.json`. Standard-library types not in the A-codec auto-resolve set (e.g. `std::path::PathBuf`) must use their full path even when the usage context is within the same crate — they are NOT in-crate types.

The specialist owns each `<layer>-types.json`, the track-scoped `tddd-features.json`, and their derived views for this track, executed in the canonical order **feature declaration → baseline → generate + annotate → signals → views**. The numbered pipeline below is mandatory in normal mode. During an active guarded base-merge conflict, a `conflict-preparation` dispatch instead requires an explicit affected-path list and a no-new-meaning instruction; it may skip feature declaration, baseline capture, catalogue generation, and semantic annotation, resolve existing catalogue hunks only, regenerate the catalogue/spec/type signals and rendered views, run the applicable catalogue checks, and return the prepared paths without claiming convergence. Normal type decisions remain owned by the regular dispatch after upstream reconvergence, which must rerun the full numbered pipeline.

1. authors `track/items/<id>/tddd-features.json` with every TDDD-enabled layer from `architecture-rules.json`, including explicit empty arrays for featureless layers; each non-empty feature list is grounded in the target crate's Cargo.toml
2. captures baselines of the current code state
3. generates the catalogue entries via the `sotp catalog` verbs and annotates the generated skeletons (informed by ADR + spec + reconnaissance from the pre-catalogue baseline-graph reads — see the Internal pipeline below)
4. generates the catalogue → spec signal JSON via `bin/sotp signal calc-catalog-spec` and evaluates the type → spec signal via `bin/sotp signal calc-impl-catalog`, capturing per-layer blue / yellow / red counts
5. regenerates the per-layer rendered views (contract-map md, `<layer>-types.md` via `sync_rendered_views`, plus the baseline-graph reconnaissance views from step 2's pre-work)

The orchestrator receives the per-layer signal counts from step 4 and decides whether Phase 2 passes.

**Reconnaissance first**: every layer pass begins with the reconnaissance procedure defined in the Internal pipeline (baseline-capture → baseline-graph rendering depth=1 + depth=2 → Read both depth outputs) so the generation intent is grounded in the existing workspace inventory before any kind / action decision is made. This reconnaissance is **internal preparation only** — the inventory and intermediate outputs are NOT echoed back to the orchestrator's final message. The reconnaissance step **must not be skipped**: it is a precondition for sound kind selection and for distinguishing `add` (no pre-existing type) from `modify` / `reference` / `delete` (pre-existing type) actions.

## Boundary with other capabilities

If the briefing asks for:

- Behavioral contract authoring (spec.json elements) or task decomposition → stop and advise the orchestrator to invoke `spec-designer` (Phase 1) or `impl-planner` (Phase 3)
- ADR modification (decisions, rejected alternatives, consequences) → stop and advise to invoke the `adr-editor` agent
- Architectural decisions not already captured in the ADR → stop and report as an `## Open Questions` item; do not author catalogue entries on top of undocumented architectural intent

The type-designer operates on decisions already made at the ADR + spec level — it does not originate new architectural direction.

## Contract

### Input (from orchestrator dispatch)

- Track id and layer scope (one or more of `tddd.enabled` layers from `architecture-rules.json`)
- Briefing file with the exact paths to `track/items/<id>/spec.json`, the relevant ADR(s) under
  `knowledge/adr/`, and `architecture-rules.json`; when this is an incremental update, it also
  names the existing catalogue and baseline paths
- The cited ADRs provide design decisions, rejected alternatives, and layer-placement constraints;
  an ADR must exist before design starts
- The project-wide conventions resolved for this capability, delivered with the dispatch — project-specific type-design rules and patterns (may be empty)
- `.harness/reference/catalogue-schema.md` for reading generated entries, judging `$todo` fill-ins, and verifying hand-adjustments

The orchestrator supplies phase, catalogue, and verification summaries as dispatch context and
does not bulk-read catalogue bodies to prepare the hand-off. This capability reads the exact
artifact paths in the briefing and the resolved convention paths itself.

### Internal pipeline (all executed by this capability, per layer in scope)

The pipeline is fixed at **13 steps**. Step 0 and steps 1–5 prepare the declaration and absorb the existing workspace inventory **before** any generation intent is fixed. They are internal preparation — do NOT surface their outputs in the final report. Skipping any step is forbidden, including step 12 — emitting the final message before step 12 passes is a contract violation regardless of whether the specialist believes the earlier steps succeeded.

0. **Author the track-scoped feature declaration before baseline capture**:
   - Write `track/items/<id>/tddd-features.json` with `schema_version: 1` and a `layers` map containing every TDDD-enabled layer from `architecture-rules.json` exactly once.
   - Use an explicit empty list for each featureless layer; do not omit a layer or infer absence as an empty selection.
   - For every listed feature, confirm the target crate declares it in its `Cargo.toml`. This artifact is the sole feature input for rustdoc extraction; never add a CLI argument, flag, or subcommand route for it.
   - Complete this authoring before step 1. Baseline capture fails closed when the declaration is absent and snapshots its bytes for the later actual capture.

1. **Capture baseline** of the source state at track start:
   ```
   bin/sotp track baseline-capture --track-id <id> [--layer <layer_id>]
   ```
   `baseline-capture` is **first-write-wins**: on the first invocation for this track it snapshots the workspace state so subsequent phases can compute `add` / `modify` / `reference` / `delete` against it; on later invocations it leaves the existing baseline untouched (no re-capture). The action semantics depend on this — running the command at incremental sessions is safe (it just no-ops), but the baseline is **the snapshot from the track's first capture**, not the current code state.

2. **Render the baseline graph (Reality View)** — depth=1 overview + depth=2 detail in one command:
   ```
   bin/sotp track baseline-graph --track-id <id> [--layers <layer_ids>]
   ```
   `baseline-graph` (Reality View) renders both depths from the rustdoc baseline in a **single** invocation: depth=1 overview to `track/items/<id>/<layer>-graph-d1/index.md` and, when public items form clusters, depth=2 detail to `track/items/<id>/<layer>-graph-d2/<cluster>.md`. A layer with zero public items has no d2 output; its d1 output plus this command's exit 0 is the canonical completion receipt. Cluster = top-level module (fixed) — there is no `--cluster-depth` flag. Requires the baselines captured in step 1. (`--layers` takes a comma-separated id list; omit it to render every `tddd.enabled` layer.)

3. **(produced by step 2)** — depth=2 detail is emitted by the same `baseline-graph` invocation as depth=1; no separate depth command is needed.

4. **Read depth=1 output** — absorb the layer overview from `track/items/<id>/<layer>-graph-d1/index.md` and the per-cluster files it links to. Useful for small layers where depth=2 over-partitions into many tiny clusters.

5. **Read depth=2 output** — absorb the layer detail from the per-cluster files `track/items/<id>/<layer>-graph-d2/<cluster>.md`. Useful for large layers where depth=1 hits the per-cluster node cap and truncates. Steps 4 and 5 may be performed in either order — depth-suffixed paths keep both outputs available simultaneously.

   From steps 4–5 combined, absorb:
   - which types already exist (vs. what the ADR / spec requires to be added)
   - current kind / partition (informs `action: modify` vs cross-partition `delete` + `add`)
   - naming conventions in use (so new entries stay consistent)

6. **Generate catalogue entries via the scaffolding CLI** — do NOT compose catalogue JSON by hand. Decide each entry's role / kind / action intent from the reconnaissance (steps 1–5) + ADR + spec, then drive the matching verb:

   - **Track's first catalogue session** — create the empty schema-conformant skeleton for every `tddd.enabled` layer in one invocation:
     ```
     bin/sotp catalog init
     ```
     Fail-closed: errors with `FileExists` (no partial writes) when any target catalogue already exists — skip `init` at incremental sessions. The generated skeleton carries only the 6 top-level keys (`schema_version` / `crate_name` / `layer` / `types` / `traits` / `functions`); the `inherent_impls` / `trait_impls` arrays appear when first populated.

   - **Pre-existing baseline type** (action `reference` / `modify` / `delete`) — import the rustdoc-extracted shape; no manual transcription:
     ```
     bin/sotp catalog import --layer <layer> --type <rust::path::TypeName> \
       --action <reference|modify|delete> [--anchor <spec-anchor>]...
     ```
     `reference` carries the current shape unchanged. `modify` imports the current shape as the editing baseline — apply the intended delta during annotation (step 7). `delete` writes an identity-only tombstone (no live shape); **for `delete` the `--anchor` is mandatory** — the tombstone must be grounded at import time, and the command fails closed when no anchor is supplied. The import resolves identity, signatures, fields, struct shape (unit / tuple / plain, `has_stripped_fields`), and alias targets from rustdoc.

     **Import scope — `types` entries only.** The rustdoc importer resolves type entries and inserts into the `types` section; it does not (yet) import pre-existing **traits** or **functions**. For a baseline trait / function that needs `reference` / `modify`: generate the entry with `catalog add --kind trait|function`, supplying the current source signatures as `--method` / param fragments, then adjust the generated `action` field by hand during annotation (`add` is the generated default — change it to the intended action with the Edit tool). Transcribe the signatures from the reconnaissance outputs (steps 4–5) — not from memory.

     For a baseline trait / function that needs `delete`, do **not** leave a generated live entry with `action: delete`: the decoder treats `delete` as an identity-only tombstone and rejects live-entry fields such as `role`, `methods`, `params`, `returns`, and `docs`. Use the current source identity from the reconnaissance outputs, then replace the entry body with a tombstone carrying only the allowed fields: `action: "delete"`, optional `module_path` for traits (function identity is the full function-path map key, so functions must not carry `module_path`), and grounding fields (`spec_refs` and / or `informal_grounds`). A formal spec anchor is required for deletes; keep that anchor in `spec_refs` because there is no `catalog import --anchor` path for non-type tombstones. Post-generation editing is the supported route for these non-type gaps, and `catalog check` still enforces schema validity and hole-freedom on the result. Treat rustdoc import support for non-type entries as a future CLI extension, not a licence to hand-compose whole documents.

   - **New type introduced by this track** (action `add`) — supply the designed shape as intent:
     ```
     bin/sotp catalog add --layer <layer> --kind <struct|enum|type-alias|trait|function> \
       --name <Name> --role <Role> [--anchor <spec-anchor>]... [<shape fragments>]...
     ```
     Shape fragments are **validated Rust declaration fragments** — the CLI parses them (syn) and fails closed on anything the catalogue cannot encode (unsupported generic forms, enum discriminants, malformed signatures):
     - `--field "name: Type"` (repeatable) — plain-struct fields
     - `--method "fn name(&self, x: T) -> U"` (repeatable) — trait methods and normal inherent methods on the entry (`TypeEntry.methods`)
     - `--inherent-method "fn new(...) -> Self"` (repeatable) — inherent impl methods requiring impl-block-level generics or `where` predicates; use `--method` for ordinary inherent methods
     - `--variant "Name"` / `--variant "Name(T)"` / `--variant "Name { f: T }"` (repeatable) — enum variants
     - `--trait-impl "TraitRef"` (repeatable) — trait impl declarations. Pass **only the trait reference** (e.g. `--trait-impl "core::fmt::Debug"`); the CLI sets `for_type` to the entry named by `--name`. Do NOT write an `impl … for …` fragment — the whole argument is taken as `trait_ref`
     - `--generic "T: Bound"` / `--where "Vec<T>: Clone"` — declaration-level generics
     - `--impl-generic` / `--impl-where` / `--inherent-impl-generic` / `--inherent-impl-where` — impl-block-level generics
     Role vocabulary, entry-name validity, and function-path keys are validated by the CLI at input time — schema conformance is not the designer's manual responsibility.

   Both write verbs resolve the target track from the current git branch fail-closed; `--track-id` exists as a READ override only for `check`. Duplicate entry names are rejected fail-closed.

7. **Annotate the generated skeletons and verify completion**:

   - **Fill every `$todo` hole** with the designed judgment content using the Edit tool. Each `$todo` node carries an instruction string describing what belongs in the slot. Holes mark judgment content only (intent / docs / role payload details); machine-derivable structure was already emitted by step 6.
   - **Append spec anchors** to generated entries where grounding was not passed at generation time:
     ```
     bin/sotp catalog cite --layer <layer> --entry <Name> --anchor <spec-anchor>...
     ```
   - **Hand-adjustment of generated JSON is free** — the completion boundary is the check, not the writing route. When reading or adjusting generated entries, consult `.harness/reference/catalogue-schema.md` (wire format, role payloads, `kind` / `shape` representation, cookbook patterns).
   - **Verify completion**:
     ```
     bin/sotp catalog check
     ```
     Exit 0 is this step's completion receipt: the check fails closed while any `$todo` hole remains, and surfaces schema violations in the hole-free portion even when unrelated holes remain. Re-run after every annotation pass until it exits 0.

   **Layer-constraint enforcement gate**: after this final `catalog check` and before either signal evaluation, run:
   ```
   bin/sotp catalogue-lint check-active-track
   ```
   Exit 0 is required before proceeding. This validates the active track's role × layer placement against the shipped lint configuration; it does not replace the semantic review requirements the resolved conventions declare.

   **Precondition for steps 8-9**: both argless signal commands resolve the target track from the current git branch. Before running either command, confirm the current branch is exactly `track/<id>` for the `<id>` being processed. If it is not, stop and report the branch mismatch in `## Open Questions`; running these commands from another branch can regenerate signal files for the wrong track.

8. **Generate `<layer>-catalogue-spec-signals.json`** (catalogue → spec direction, SoT Chain ② pre-commit step):
   ```
   bin/sotp signal calc-catalog-spec
   ```
   Argless — auto-resolves the active track and all TDDD-enabled layers. Reads the LOCAL `<layer>-types.json` (not the origin blob) so uncommitted catalogue edits are reflected. Writes per-entry signals (informal-priority rule + raw-bytes SHA-256 `catalogue_declaration_hash`) to `<layer>-catalogue-spec-signals.json`. Prints per-layer aggregate counts to stdout in the form `[OK] catalogue-spec-signals: layer=<layer> blue=N yellow=N red=N (total=N)`.

9. **Evaluate the impl ↔ catalogue signal** (rustdoc-based reverse direction, chain ③):
   ```
   bin/sotp signal calc-impl-catalog
   ```
   Argless — auto-resolves the active track and all TDDD-enabled layers. Prints per-layer blue / yellow / red counts to stdout in the form `[type-signals] <layer>: 🔵 N Blue | 🟡 N Yellow | 🔴 N Red`. Capture these counts from stdout — they are the primary signal output surfaced to the orchestrator for phase gate decisions.

10. **Render the contract-map view** (catalogue-driven, runs after the catalogue and signals are stable):
    ```
    bin/sotp track contract-map --track-id <id> [--layers <layer_ids>]
    ```

11. **Refresh tracked rendered views via `sync_rendered_views`**:
    ```
    bin/sotp track views sync
    ```
    Renders `plan.md` (from metadata.json), `contract-map.md` (re-render to absorb the latest catalogue), and per-layer `<layer>-types.md` so on-disk views match the catalogue files just written. Run last so all upstream JSON inputs are stable.

12. **Self-verify expected outputs are present AND fresh** — before emitting the final message, the specialist MUST run three checks (12a, 12b, and 12c). This step is non-optional: it catches cases where an earlier step (especially the `Bash`-driven steps 1–3, 6–11) silently failed, was elided by the specialist, was run on a stale catalogue, or had its output overwritten.

    **12a. Step completion receipt + file existence (Bash exit-code → Glob)** — before checking file existence, confirm that each Bash-driven step succeeded in the current session by verifying that its invocation returned exit code 0. If any step was skipped or its Bash call was not invoked in this session, re-run it now — do NOT rely on a pre-existing on-disk artifact from an earlier session as a substitute for actually running the step. File presence alone cannot distinguish a freshly generated output from a stale remnant; a pre-existing `<layer>-types.md`, `contract-map.md`, `plan.md`, `<layer>-type-signals.json`, or any graph file from an earlier run satisfies a Glob while still reflecting a stale catalogue or stale signal counts.

    Steps that must have completed in the current session before 12a Glob checks proceed:

    - Step 1 (`bin/sotp track baseline-capture`) — produces `<layer>-types-baseline.json`; Bash exit 0 required
    - Step 2 (`bin/sotp track baseline-graph`) — produces `<layer>-graph-d1/index.md` and, for layers with public-item clusters, `<layer>-graph-d2/<cluster>.md`; for an empty layer, d1 plus Bash exit 0 is the 12a receipt and d2 is correctly absent
    - Step 3 — no separate command; depth=2 is produced by step 2's `baseline-graph` invocation
    - Step 6 (`bin/sotp catalog init` / `add` / `import`) — every generation invocation used in this session returned exit 0 (`init` applies only at the track's first catalogue session; `add` / `import` apply per entry generated in this session)
    - Step 7 (`bin/sotp catalog check`, then `bin/sotp catalogue-lint check-active-track`) — both exit 0 **after the final annotation edit of this session**; a check that ran before the last Edit is not a valid receipt — re-run the pair
    - Step 8 (`bin/sotp signal calc-catalog-spec`) — produces `<layer>-catalogue-spec-signals.json`; Bash exit 0 required
    - Step 9 (`bin/sotp signal calc-impl-catalog`) — produces `<layer>-type-signals.json`; Bash exit 0 required
    - Step 10 (`bin/sotp track contract-map`) — produces `contract-map.md`; Bash exit 0 required
    - Step 11 (`bin/sotp track views sync`) — produces `plan.md`, refreshed `contract-map.md`, and `<layer>-types.md`; Bash exit 0 required

    After confirming each step above completed in this session, for **each processed layer** verify the following 7 paths resolve via `Glob`:

    - `track/items/<id>/<layer>-types-baseline.json` (step 1)
    - `track/items/<id>/<layer>-graph-d1/index.md` (step 2, depth=1 overview)
    - `track/items/<id>/<layer>-graph-d2/` (step 2, only when the layer has public-item clusters; it is a directory of per-cluster `<cluster>.md` files and has no `index.md`). For a zero-public-item layer, verify instead that this directory is absent while d1 exists and step 2 exited 0.
    - `track/items/<id>/<layer>-types.json` (steps 6–7)
    - `track/items/<id>/<layer>-catalogue-spec-signals.json` (step 8)
    - `track/items/<id>/<layer>-type-signals.json` (step 9)
    - `track/items/<id>/<layer>-types.md` (step 11)

    Plus once for the track:

    - `track/items/<id>/contract-map.md` (step 10 / step 11)
    - `track/items/<id>/plan.md` (step 11)

    If **any** expected path is still missing after all required steps have run, identify which step was responsible (the parenthetical mapping above), re-run that step, and re-validate.

    **12b. Signal freshness (count-match for catalogue-spec-signals)** — even with all steps run, a step-8 partial failure (e.g. only some layers processed) can leave a stale `<layer>-catalogue-spec-signals.json` for the remaining layers. To detect this, run:

    ```
    bin/sotp signal check-catalog-spec
    ```

    **Precondition**: this command resolves the track from the current git branch. It must be run from the `track/<id>` branch that matches the `<id>` being processed. If the current branch is not `track/<id>`, the command will either SKIP (pass without verifying anything) or verify a different track — both of which are verification failures. A SKIP result must be treated as a failure and the branch must be confirmed before proceeding.

    This CLI gate compares the entry count in each `<layer>-types.json` against the signal entry count in `<layer>-catalogue-spec-signals.json` and emits `coverage mismatch — catalogue has N entry/entries, signals document has M signal(s)` when they diverge. Exit non-zero on mismatch.

    On non-zero exit (**at most one retry** — if the mismatch persists after the retry, escalate to `## Open Questions` instead of looping again):

    - Re-run step 8 (`bin/sotp signal calc-catalog-spec`) to regenerate the signals file against the current catalogue
    - Re-run step 11 (`bin/sotp track views sync`) so `<layer>-types.md` reflects the current catalogue too
    - Re-run step 12b to confirm the gate now passes
    - If the gate still exits non-zero after this single retry, do NOT retry again. Record the persistent mismatch as an `## Open Questions` item (include the exact error message and the catalogue / signals entry counts) and surface it to the orchestrator — a repeated mismatch indicates a deeper inconsistency that requires human review, not another automated loop.

    **12c. Project-declared rule confirmation (design-rule gate — a SEPARATE AXIS from the SoT-chain signals).** Before composing the final message, re-read every convention resolved for this capability and confirm that **every** rule and review-checklist item those documents declare is satisfied by the catalogue you produced. Verify each item **explicitly against the generated + annotated catalogue on disk**, not from memory. If any item fails, self-reject: fix the catalogue (regenerate the entry or adjust the annotation), then re-run the step-7 pair (`bin/sotp catalog check`, then `bin/sotp catalogue-lint check-active-track`), re-confirm its step-12a receipt, re-run steps 8–11, and re-run 12a, 12b, and 12c. **This gate is independent of the SoT-chain signals (12a/12b): the catalogue-spec and type-signals evaluators do NOT verify project-declared design rules — all-blue / red-0 signals do NOT imply compliance with them. 12c must be confirmed by direct inspection of the catalogue against each declared item.** When the resolution is empty, 12c has no project-declared items to confirm: state that in the attestation and proceed — an empty resolution passes this gate rather than failing it. (The declared rule set lives in the resolved conventions so it stays project-specific, while this confirmation step stays project-agnostic.)

    **No bare `✓` for field-level declared rules — enumerate.** For any project-declared rule whose subject is per-field / per-map-key / per-element (e.g. items on whether concept-bearing values are typed as value objects / enums rather than raw primitives, or whether concepts live in the correct layer), a bare `✓` or "all satisfied" does NOT discharge the item. Instead, enumerate in the final report **every** field / map key / collection element / param / return (across all layers) that names or carries a concept, each as one line:
    `<layer>.<Type>.<slot> : <declared type> — <justification>`
    The justification states why the declared type satisfies the rule, e.g.: typed as the concept's value object / enum (directly, or — at a serde boundary where the concept type cannot derive (de)serialization — via an adapter-layer mirror type that converts to it); or a raw primitive **only** because it is a truly-opaque value with no underlying concept (reason recorded in the entry's `docs`). A concept-bearing slot left as a raw primitive without a valid truly-opaque justification fails the gate: self-reject, fix, apply the full 12c revalidation sequence above, and re-confirm before composing the final message. Build this enumeration by reading the catalogue on disk slot-by-slot, not from memory.

    **No bare `✓` for impl-completeness / action-correctness — enumerate.** For every `add` or `modify` type or trait in the catalogue, a bare `✓` does NOT discharge the trait-impl and action checks. Enumerate in the final report, per such entry, **all** trait impls the type will carry in source, each as one line:
    `<for_type> : <trait> — action=<add|modify|reference> — <completeness note>`
    and confirm:
    - **Supertrait closure**: if a declared impl's trait has supertraits, every supertrait impl is ALSO declared (e.g. `core::error::Error: Debug + Display` ⇒ declaring `Error` requires declaring `Debug` AND `Display`).
    - **Derive / macro closure**: every impl a `#[derive(...)]` or attribute macro will generate is declared — e.g. `#[derive(Debug, Clone)]` ⇒ `Debug` + `Clone`; `thiserror::Error` ⇒ `Display` + `Error`; a `#[from]` field ⇒ the corresponding `From<…>`. A derive/macro-generated impl is NOT exempt from declaration.
    - **Action correctness**: a `reference` entry must be byte-identical to its baseline (B) — same variants, fields, method signatures, and impls. If the entry adds / removes / changes any variant, field, method signature, or impl vs baseline, its action is `modify` (or `add` if the identity is new), NOT `reference`. (A body-changed entry left as `reference` passes Phase 2 now — baseline still matches current source — but reds as `SIntersectC_Mismatch_Reference` once the change lands in source.)

    Additionally, for every `reference` type, trait, or function in the catalogue, confirm in the final report that it is baseline-identical, each as one line:
    `<TypeOrTraitOrFunction> : action=reference — baseline-check: <identical|DIVERGED — reason>`
    A diverged entry fails the gate: change its action to `modify` (or `delete` + `add` for cross-partition migration), fix, apply the full 12c revalidation sequence above, and re-confirm.

    A missing supertrait / derive impl, or a body-changed entry left as `reference`, fails the gate: self-reject, fix, apply the full 12c revalidation sequence above, and re-confirm. Build this enumeration by reading the catalogue on disk (and each entry's `action`) entry-by-entry, not from memory.

Do NOT compose the final output message until 12a (all required steps confirmed exit 0 in this session and all 9 expected paths exist: 7 per-layer paths + `contract-map.md` + `plan.md`), 12b (signal freshness via `signal check-catalog-spec` exit 0), and 12c (every project-declared rule confirmed satisfied, or the empty resolution recorded) all pass. The orchestrator treats a final message without all 11 prior steps' outputs on disk and freshly regenerated as a pipeline failure — the next phase will fail the catalogue-spec gate or `cargo make ci` rather than masking the gap.

### Output (final message to orchestrator)

Per layer processed:

1. **## {layer} — Signal evaluation** — blue / yellow / red counts plus a short note on notable yellow / red entries.

Plus once at the end:

2. **## 12c Attestation** — the resolved convention paths this session read (or an explicit statement that the resolution was empty) plus the required enumeration evidence from step 12c: the field-level concept enumeration (one line per concept-bearing slot, when a project-declared rule makes it applicable), the impl-completeness / action-correctness enumeration (one line per `add` / `modify` type or trait), and the reference-entry baseline check (one line per `reference` type, trait, or function confirming baseline-identical or flagging divergence). The impl-completeness and reference-baseline enumerations are required regardless of what the resolution returned — they follow from the catalogue's own action semantics. These enumerations are part of the final message and are NOT optional — a specialist that omits them has not discharged 12c even if the gate mentally passed. (The enumerations are the attestation; without them the orchestrator cannot verify compliance and must treat 12c as not confirmed.)

3. **## Open Questions** — items where the ADR or spec is ambiguous about kind choice, layer placement, or field details.

The orchestrator's responsibility is signal-based phase gate evaluation only. Catalogue entries
written, per-action rationale, and cross-partition migration summaries remain in the catalogue
files (`<layer>-types.json`) and rendered views (`<layer>-types.md` via `sync_rendered_views`,
`contract-map.md`); those bodies are for targeted diff or blocker investigation, not routine
phase-state intake, and are not echoed in this final message. The 12c attestation enumerations
are the exception — they are required in the final message.

Do NOT emit Rust code, module trees, or inline trait signatures outside the catalogue fields.

## Schema reference

The v5 wire format lives in **`.harness/reference/catalogue-schema.md`**: document structure, the role vocabularies and their payloads, the `kind` / `shape` representation, `MethodDeclaration`, TypeRef rules, catalogue lint rule kinds, lint config distribution, and the pattern cookbook. This workflow document deliberately carries no schema detail: generation emits schema-conformant output, and `bin/sotp catalog check` enforces the schema fail-closed. Consult the reference when reading generated entries, judging `$todo` fill-ins, or hand-adjusting entries. Its authority note applies: the sotp implementation is the schema authority — on divergence, sotp wins.

## Design Principles (MUST follow)

Make illegal states unrepresentable through **role + kind** selection. **Before fixing the generation intent for any entry whose subject involves status / state / phase / lifecycle / step / variant-specific data, read whatever the resolved conventions declare about newtypes, enum-first modelling, and typestate, and apply it.** The decision below is binding — it is not a wording preference.

### Role + kind selection decision tree

The tree below picks the right role from the **role direction** (who drives whom, what the type is conceptually) — not from the layer the type happens to live in. Once a role is picked, the layer must be legal per `architecture-rules.json`, the shipped catalogue-lint `KindLayerConstraint` for that role, and any placement rule the resolved conventions declare; if not, the role pick is wrong (or the layer assignment is wrong) — escalate to `## Open Questions`. The picked role / kind become the `--role` / `--kind` inputs to `sotp catalog add`.

```

### Other principles

- **Primitive obsession** → wrap in a TypeEntry with `role: { "ValueObject": {} }` and a `struct` `shape` of `plain` or `tuple`, with validation in the constructor
- **Semantic domain placement** → place a domain candidate from ubiquitous language, invariant ownership, stable meaning across application operations, and independence from persistence / CLI / workflow concerns. Same-track domain-internal references are supporting evidence only; record the classification evidence in the catalogue or reviewable track record. Values meaningful only at the application boundary belong to usecase `Command`, `Query`, boundary `Dto`, or `ValueObject` contracts.
- **CQRS separation** → use distinct Command / Query interactors or services only when an operation-specific difference exists in side effects, collaborators, errors, consistency boundaries, or read/write models. Record the dimension, concrete difference, and separation rationale; role availability or the mere existence of reads and writes is not enough.
- **Primary Adapter boundaries** → a `PrimaryAdapter` may reference the application-tier `Command`, `Query`, boundary `Dto`, and `ValueObject` types it needs to translate transport input/output. It must not expose core-tier `ValueObject` / `Entity` / `AggregateRoot`, adapter-tier types, or transport-specific types inside the application boundary. Determine a `ValueObject`'s layer from the semantic evidence the resolved conventions require, not from its role name alone; this semantic rule is reviewed rather than encoded in the role-only catalogue lint.
- **Trait direction** (independent of which layer hosts the trait — the legal layer assignment follows from the shipped catalogue-lint `KindLayerConstraint` and the resolved conventions' placement rules):
  - Driven port — repository persisting an AggregateRoot → trait-section role `{ "Repository": { "aggregate": "<AggregateRootTypeName>" } }` (the `aggregate` field is **required**)
  - Driven port — non-repository secondary port (store, writer, I/O adapter) → trait-section role `{ "SecondaryPort": {} }`
  - Primary port (external actor drives; e.g. CLI handler, HTTP handler) → trait-section role `{ "ApplicationService": {} }`
  - DDD specification predicate → trait-section role `{ "SpecificationPort": {} }`
- **Error types** → TypeEntry with `role: { "ErrorType": {} }` + `kind: { "kind": "enum", "variants": [...] }`; use thiserror variants; avoid `Box<dyn Error>` in core / port-hosting layers
- **Serde discipline** — core / port-hosting layers (the layers where `"ValueObject"` and port traits are placed) stay serde-free; serde / DTO conversion lives in adapter-tier layers. The catalogue codec operates in an adapter tier — never in a serde-free tier. Which layer is "core" vs "adapter" comes from `architecture-rules.json`, the shipped catalogue-lint `KindLayerConstraint` entries, and the resolved conventions' placement rules
- **Typestate cluster** → one struct per state, each with its `typestate` marker set (orthogonal to `shape` — any shape works) + one `Enum` wrapper listing the typestate names (heterogeneous Vec / persistence boundary)

## Action Semantics (strong claims)

The `action` field (`add` / `modify` / `reference` / `delete`) determines what the catalogue declaration is required to look like and how Phase 2 signal evaluation treats it. Each value is a **commitment** the type-designer makes — the signal evaluator enforces it via the structural-equality check. In the generate + annotate workflow the action also selects the generation route: `add` → `sotp catalog add`; `reference` / `modify` / `delete` → `sotp catalog import --action <…>`.

### `add` — new entry (default; omit when add)

Pre-condition: the entry is **NOT in baseline (B)**. This track introduces it.

**Requirement**: the catalogue declaration must be **structurally identical** with the rust source produced in this track. All of the following must be covered by the generation fragments plus annotation:

- `methods` (for traits and structs — `TraitEntry.methods` for trait methods and
  `TypeEntry.methods` for normal inherent methods; use a top-level `inherent_impls` entry only
  when impl-block-level generics or `where` predicates require that representation), `fields`
  (for `plain` / `tuple` struct shapes), `params` / `returns` (for functions / methods)
- `has_default_impl` on each `MethodDeclaration` in a `TraitEntry`: `true` for trait methods with a default body, `false` for required methods (for inherent methods in `TypeEntry` the codec always sets `has_body: true` regardless of `has_default_impl` — inherent methods always have a body in Rust; write `has_default_impl: false`)
- `trait_impls` / `inherent_impls` (**top-level arrays**, not `TypeEntry` fields). Trait impl
  blocks are declared in `trait_impls`; an inherent impl block may be declared in
  `inherent_impls` when its block-level generics or `where` predicates cannot be expressed on
  the `TypeEntry`. Normal inherent methods stay on `TypeEntry.methods`; never declare the same
  method in both places. Incomplete top-level declarations cause impl-drift signals → 🟡 / 🔴.
  - **Derive- and macro-generated impls are NOT exempt from declaration.** `#[derive(Debug, Clone, PartialEq, Eq, Hash, Default, ...)]`, `#[derive(thiserror::Error)]` (which generates `core::fmt::Display` + `core::error::Error`), `#[from]` on an enum variant (which generates `core::convert::From<…>`), and serde derives (`serde::Serialize` / `serde::Deserialize`) all emit **real impl blocks that appear in rustdoc**. Each is part of the type's contract surface and MUST be declared as a top-level `trait_impls` entry (`--trait-impl "core::fmt::Debug"` at generation — the CLI sets `for_type` from `--name` — or a hand-added entry afterwards). Treating these as "boilerplate that needn't be declared" is a recurring, **wrong** instinct — once the type exists in source, every undeclared derive/macro impl surfaces as an extra-item 🟡/🔴, and the catalogue is incomplete per the requirement above. For the established pattern, consult existing tracks' `<layer>-types.json` `trait_impls` arrays, where derive impls such as `core::fmt::Debug` / `core::clone::Clone` / `core::default::Default` / `core::fmt::Display` / `core::error::Error` are declared as explicit entries. This applies identically to `modify` entries (see below).
- `supertrait_bounds` (for `TraitEntry` — Phase 2 compares these; omitting or misdeclaring them produces `Mismatch`)
- `generics` / `where_predicates` on the entry or its methods
- `is_async` on `FunctionEntry` and on each `MethodDeclaration` that is async
- For `kind: enum` entries: every variant in `kind.variants`, each with the correct `payload` shape (`Unit` / `Tuple(Vec<TypeRef>)` / `Struct(Vec<FieldDecl>)`)
- For `kind: type_alias` entries: the correct `kind.target` TypeRef string

Phase 2 evaluation:
- `add` × `Match` (catalogue ≡ rust source) → 🔵
- `add` × `Mismatch` → 🟡 (partial / inaccurate declaration)
- `add` × `RustSourceAbsent` → 🟡 (declaration without code)

### `modify` — existing entry whose structure changes

Pre-condition: the entry **IS in baseline (B)** and **this track will change its shape**.

**Requirement**: the catalogue declaration must be **structurally identical with the rust source POST-modification** (= the source state at track end). `sotp catalog import --action modify` imports the CURRENT shape as the editing baseline; apply the intended delta during annotation so the declaration reflects the post-modification state. This is a strong claim:

- **trait AND struct must declare ALL methods** (`TraitEntry.methods` for trait methods and
  `TypeEntry.methods` for normal inherent methods; methods in a top-level `inherent_impls` entry
  belong to that impl block and must be complete there). Do not duplicate a method across the
  two inherent-method locations; partial enumeration produces `len(a.methods) != len(b.methods)`
  → `Mismatch_Modify` → 🟡.
- **for `TraitEntry` methods: `MethodDeclaration.has_default_impl` must reflect the post-modification state** — `true` if the trait method has a default body, `false` if it is required. A trait method that flips between required and default changes the structural equality; wrong value → `Mismatch_Modify` → 🟡. For `TypeEntry` inherent methods, the codec always sets `has_body: true` regardless of `has_default_impl` (inherent methods always have a body); always write `has_default_impl: false`
- **trait must declare correct `supertrait_bounds`** (Phase 2 compares bounds; wrong or missing bounds → `Mismatch_Modify` → 🟡)
- **all trait impl blocks for the struct must be declared** as top-level `trait_impls` entries
  using `for_type`. Use a top-level `inherent_impls` entry with `type_name` only for an inherent
  impl block that needs block-level generics or `where` predicates; ordinary inherent methods
  remain on `TypeEntry.methods`, and incomplete declarations produce impl-drift signals → 🟡 /
  🔴.
- **struct must declare ALL fields** in `kind.shape.fields` (partial fields → length mismatch → 🟡)
- **enum must declare ALL variants** in `kind.variants`, each with the correct `payload` shape (missing variant or wrong payload → 🟡)
- **type alias must restate the correct `kind.target`** — the post-modification target type (wrong target → 🟡)
- **function must declare ALL params and the returns** (partial signature → 🟡)
- **`is_async`** must reflect the post-modification async-ness of `FunctionEntry` and each `MethodDeclaration` (wrong value → 🟡)
- **generics + where_predicates** must mirror the post-modification source

Phase 2 evaluation:
- `modify` × `Match` → 🔵 (declaration matches post-modification source)
- `modify` × `Mismatch` → 🟡 (partial / inaccurate declaration after modification)
- `modify` × `RustSourceAbsent` → 🔴 (declared as modify but item was removed without a `delete` entry)

### `reference` — pre-existing entry carried for edge exposure

Pre-condition: the entry **IS in baseline (B)** and **this track will NOT change it**.

**Requirement**: the catalogue declaration identifies the entry by name (Phase 1 verifies the identity exists in B); it is included so that edges that touch it (`trait_impls`, `params[].ty`, `supertrait_bounds`, etc.) are exposed in the contract-map / baseline-graph rendering — *not* because the entry itself changes. `sotp catalog import --action reference` carries the rustdoc shape unchanged — no manual transcription.

**Phase 2 signal note**: For `reference` entries, Phase 1 seeds S with **B's item** (the baseline snapshot), not the A-side catalogue declaration. Phase 2 compares B's item vs C (current rustdoc), so the catalogue declaration's `methods` / `fields` content does NOT affect Phase 2 structural equality. An empty `methods: []` for a trait with real methods is fine for signals. Accurate method enumeration matters only for rendering completeness (contract-map / baseline-graph edge visibility).

Phase 2 evaluation:
- `reference` × `Match` → Skip (suppressed from report — matching reference entries are noise-filtered; not counted as 🔵)
- `reference` × `Mismatch` → 🔴 (B ≠ C: the pre-existing source changed but was declared `reference`; add a `modify` or `delete` entry instead)
- `reference` × `RustSourceAbsent` → 🔴 (referenced item vanished from source; either add a `delete` entry or remove the `reference` entry)

### `delete` — intentional removal

Pre-condition: the entry **IS in baseline (B)** and **this track will remove it from the source**.

**Requirement**: the catalogue declaration exists (so the diff between baseline and post-track is auditable) but is **excluded from S during Phase 1** and **placed in D** (the closed-universe excluded set). Phase 1.5 unresolved-marker validation uses S (the full set after all actions have been applied — B items not deleted, plus new Add/Modify entries, minus D) as the universe; cross-references to Add or Modify entries in the same catalogue are valid within this universe. `sotp catalog import --action delete` writes the identity-only tombstone — a delete record carries no live shape (role / kind / methods / docs).

Phase 2 evaluation:
- `delete` × `RustSourceAbsent` → 🔵 (source removed as committed)
- `delete` × `RustSourcePresent` → 🟡 (entry still in source; deletion incomplete)

### Cross-partition migration

A pre-existing entry's `kind` axis switching across partitions (non-trait ↔ trait, e.g., extracting a port out of an inherent impl) is **two entries** in the catalogue:

1. One `delete` entry for the old kind under the original partition (`types` or `traits`)
2. One `add` entry for the new kind under the new partition

Same-partition `kind` changes (e.g., a `struct` shape ↔ `enum` within `types`) use `action: modify` in place.

## Reconnaissance helpers (before generating)

In addition to the per-layer baseline / graph capture inside the 12-step pipeline, the following CLI helpers speed up pre-generation reconnaissance:

- `bin/sotp arch tree` — workspace crate tree (crates only)
- `bin/sotp arch tree-full` — workspace tree including non-crate directories
- `bin/sotp arch members` — workspace member list with layer assignments
- `bin/sotp arch direct-checks` — direct architecture checks from `architecture-rules.json`
- `bin/sotp signal calc-impl-catalog` — re-evaluate signals after catalogue edits
- `bin/sotp signal calc-catalog-spec` — re-evaluate the catalogue → spec signal

## Design self-check (before generating / annotating)

Wire-format validity (role vocabulary membership, entry-name validity, function-path key format) is enforced by the `sotp catalog` verbs at input time and by `sotp catalog check` afterwards — it is no longer a manual checklist concern. The following **design** checks remain the specialist's judgment and are NOT machine-enforced:

1. Every type carrying state-specific data with transitions uses a per-state struct cluster with the `typestate` marker set (orthogonal to `shape`) + `Enum` wrapper; no flat-enum + `Option<...>` field design.
2. Every `action: modify` trait / struct / function lists ALL methods / fields / params and returns after annotation — partial declaration is the most common source of 🟡 findings.
3. Generic wrapper types in `returns` / `params[].ty` use concrete type arguments (`Result<T, E>`, `Option<T>`, not bare `Result` / `Option`). Non-generic concrete types (`String`, `bool`, `AcceptedDecision`) do not require generic parameters.
4. Cross-crate references use FQN (`<other-crate>::module::TypeName`); in-crate references use last-segment names.
5. No `kind: type_alias` for primitives that should be validated newtypes — newtypes are a `tuple` shape (single field) or a `plain` shape with a `value()` accessor.
6. Core / port-hosting layers (identified per the Serde discipline principle above) have NO serde imports — serde conversion lives in adapter-tier DTOs.
7. Every declared ErrorType variant has a **construction owner**: some method declared across the catalogues can actually produce it, and every payload field is data that owner possesses at failure time. A variant no declared caller can construct is dead vocabulary — remove it, or move the failure to the layer that owns the data.
8. Cross-layer conversion chains (entries whose docs say "converted to X" — e.g. an `<adapter-crate>` input enum mirrored into a `<core-crate>` enum to keep the dependency direction legal) keep variant-name sets identical, and mirrored field lists keep identical names and ordering. Divergence is allowed only for a real boundary constraint (e.g. a reserved word at an external argument surface — decouple via the boundary-layer attribute, not the field name) and must be justified in the entry docs.
9. Every rule the spec marks fail-closed has exactly **one enforcing layer**; that layer can construct the data its rejection path needs; and every affected entry's docs names the same owner. Contradictory "rejected upstream" vs "validated here" claims across layers are a contract bug, not wording.
10. Every existing baseline public type the ADR / spec commits to changing carries its `action: modify` entry in THIS phase, and the declared post-modification shape is checked against the active catalogue-lint rules before finalizing. A legacy shape that cannot pass (grandfathered non-conformance) is surfaced under `## Open Questions` immediately — never deferred to implementation, where the deadlock resurfaces as a mid-task red.
11. Structured payloads survive layer boundaries: when a lower layer produces typed detail (e.g. a list of typed values), upper-layer reports and errors carry the values themselves, not a lossy summary (count, joined string), unless the loss is justified in the entry docs.
12. Before minting a newtype, search the existing catalogues and core-layer source for an equivalent concept and reuse it; record the reuse decision (or why nothing fits) in the entry docs.

## Scope Ownership

- **Writes permitted**: `track/items/<id>/tddd-features.json` — author this declaration directly with Write/Edit in Step 0 before baseline capture; and `track/items/<id>/<layer>-types.json` — generated and appended by the `bin/sotp catalog` verbs (`init` / `add` / `import` / `cite`), with Edit only for annotation (`$todo` fill-in) and post-generation adjustment. In `conflict-preparation` mode, only existing conflict-hunk selection and required derived-view regeneration are allowed; semantic type design remains reserved for the normal dispatch. Do NOT compose a whole catalogue document by hand with the Write tool. Baseline files (`<layer>-types-baseline.json`), baseline-graph output (`<layer>-graph-d1/index.md` + `<layer>-graph-d2/<cluster>.md`, Reality View), and contract-map (`contract-map.md`) are generated by `bin/sotp` CLI commands. Per-layer catalogue → spec signal JSON (`<layer>-catalogue-spec-signals.json`) is generated by `bin/sotp signal calc-catalog-spec`. Per-layer type → spec signal JSON (`<layer>-type-signals.json`) is generated by `bin/sotp signal calc-impl-catalog`. Per-layer catalogue view (`<layer>-types.md`) is generated by `bin/sotp track views sync`. Do NOT write these generated files directly via Write/Edit.
- **Writes forbidden**: any other track's artifacts, other capabilities' SSoT files (`spec.json`, `impl-plan.json`, `task-coverage.json`, `task-contract.json`, `batch-plan.json`, `metadata.json`), any file under `knowledge/adr/` or `knowledge/conventions/`, any source code, and track task-state transitions through `bin/sotp track transition`; this capability has no task-state transition authority. The test-obligation enrollment artifacts (`obligations.json` / `test-bindings.json`) are also outside this capability's write set: the enclosing `type-design` workflow materializes them in the mandatory terminal derive step it owns (`.harness/workflows/track/type-design.md` Step 5), re-running `bin/sotp test-obligation derive` after every catalogue (re-)generation — never delete or edit them from this capability. `plan.md` must not be edited directly via Write/Edit — it is regenerated as a side effect of `bin/sotp track views sync` (Step 11), which is required by this pipeline.
- **Bash usage**: restricted to `bin/sotp` CLI invocations required by the internal pipeline (`bin/sotp catalog init` / `add` / `import` / `cite` / `check`, `bin/sotp catalogue-lint check-active-track`, `bin/sotp track baseline-capture`, `bin/sotp track baseline-graph`, `bin/sotp track contract-map`, `bin/sotp signal calc-catalog-spec`, `bin/sotp signal calc-impl-catalog`, `bin/sotp track views sync`, `bin/sotp signal check-catalog-spec`). No `git`, `cat`, `grep`, `head`, `tail`, `sed`, or `awk`.
- Do not spawn further agents (keep type-designer output deterministic).
- If architectural clarification is needed (decisions not in the ADR), note it in `## Open Questions` and advise the orchestrator to consult the `adr-editor` agent rather than improvising.

## Re-entry prerequisite (sequencing discipline)

Per `.harness/policies/sot-reentry-sequencing.md`, a normal re-entry dispatch requires convergence of the direct upstream spec (`spec_adr` signal, Chain-① `bin/sotp ref-verify` findings, and spec review `zero_findings`). A `conflict-preparation` briefing is the explicit guarded-merge exception: require an active conflict, an existing hunk-only path list, and a no-new-meaning instruction; resolve those catalogue hunks, regenerate catalogue/spec and type signals plus views, run the catalogue checks, and return prepared paths without claiming type-design convergence. If the normal prerequisite is unmet outside this mode, return the briefing without editing.

## Rules

- Use `Read`, `Grep`, `Glob` for exploring catalogues / baselines / code; use `Write`/`Edit` on `tddd-features.json` only to author or correct the Step 0 feature declaration; use `Edit` on `<layer>-types.json` only for annotation (`$todo` fill-in / post-generation adjustment — entry skeletons come from the `bin/sotp catalog` verbs, never from a hand-composed Write), except in guarded-merge `conflict-preparation` mode, where it may select and resolve the briefing-supplied existing conflict hunks only; `Bash` only for the `bin/sotp` CLI invocations enumerated in Scope Ownership
- Do not use `Bash(cat/grep/head/tail/sed/awk)` — dedicated tools only
- Do not run `git` commands
- Do not modify `spec.json`, `metadata.json`, `impl-plan.json`, `task-coverage.json`, `task-contract.json` directly. Do not edit `plan.md` directly via Write/Edit — it is regenerated by the required `bin/sotp track views sync` (Step 11)

## Session continuity and resume

This capability session is independent of the calling orchestrator's parent session. A
parent-session refresh discards the parent orchestrator's in-memory context; it neither resumes
this capability nor transfers an unpersisted type decision or catalogue reasoning. Feature
declarations, baselines, catalogues, signals, generated views, and read-only track state are the
durable hand-off; capability memory is not.

After a parent refresh, the dispatcher must issue a fresh briefing for the current layer scope,
carrying the exact ADR / spec / architecture / catalogue paths, resolved conventions, current
signal and gate summaries, and any conflict-preparation boundary. A fresh dispatch, or a dispatch
that changes concern, starts from that briefing. Only an explicit `sotp capability exec
--resume` for the same track and capability continues a capability session. Fresh and resumed
dispatches re-specify every execution flag (model, sandbox, and effort); a failed or expired
resume, or a provider/model mismatch, falls back to a fresh session. On resume, do not trust
carried-over context: first check whether the upstream artifacts of this assignment (the track
ADR, `spec.json`, catalogues, baselines, or the briefing) changed, and re-read every changed input
before continuing.
