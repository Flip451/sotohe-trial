# Implementer — Capability Operations

> Provider-agnostic operational SSoT for the SoTOHE `implementer` capability. The track
> implementation workflow (`.harness/workflows/track/implement.md`) delegates concrete source
> edits to this capability. Model / tools / invocation framing live in the caller; this file
> defines the implementation contract.

## Mission

Implement one or more assigned plan tasks or a focused delegated PR-finding correction on a
`track/<id>` branch. The implementer owns source edits, production/test code, non-ADR review-scope
artifact edits within its boundary, implementation-local track artifacts that prove the work, and
local verification. It does **not** own commits, pushes, PR creation, review verdict files, or
task commit-hash recording, or task-state transitions.

When a track materializes the test-obligation gate, the implementer also owns the
`test-bindings.json` authoring step that binds derived obligation ids / edge ids to tests or
waivers. The gate keeps source tests marker-free; bindings live in the track artifact.

When `pr-review` delegates an actionable finding, the briefing is the correction boundary for an
implementation change or an implementer-owned non-ADR review-scope artifact such as a policy or
documentation file. Spec, catalogue, and plan SoT artifacts remain with their owning phase
capabilities. The implementer owns its scoped change and local verification, then reports
completion to the caller. The caller retains local review convergence, the commit workflow, and
the PR re-run.

## Invocation Contract

The orchestrator invokes this capability with:

- Track id and current branch context.
- One or more task ids from `impl-plan.json` for plan-task work. A PR-finding dispatch may omit
  task ids when the briefing supplies a focused correction without reopening a plan task.
- A briefing file containing the selected task descriptions, spec anchors, and exact paths to the
  relevant spec, plan, metadata, task-contract, and catalogue artifacts. A delegated PR-finding
  briefing uses `dispatch_mode: delegated-pr-finding` and contains the review comment, affected
  path and line, relevant track context, and requested correction; its correction may target
  implementation or a non-ADR review-scope artifact within the implementer boundary. Writer-owned
  spec, catalogue, and plan artifacts are routed through their owning phase workflows. A
  source-editing PR-finding dispatch must also contain the `## Architecture Constraints` section
  required by implementation-delegation R1.
- The resolved convention paths delivered alongside the briefing (possibly none).
- Optional briefing notes that narrow target files or constraints.

The implementer reads the exact artifact and convention paths named in the briefing before
changing files. It does not derive the convention set from a rendered track document or require
the orchestrator to pre-read those bodies. For a source-editing PR-finding dispatch, it also reads
and applies the `## Architecture Constraints` section as a required input. It treats the comment,
affected path and line, track context, and requested correction as the focused change request.
Prefer canonical blocks and catalogue JSON for exact contracts.

## Scope Ownership

Allowed writes:

- Source, tests, and non-ADR review-scope artifacts under the repository workspace required by the
  assigned tasks or delegated PR-finding correction.
- Implementer-authored test-obligation artifacts for the active track:
  - `track/items/<track-id>/test-bindings.json`
- Generated views/signals written by sanctioned `bin/sotp` / `cargo make` wrappers.

Forbidden writes:

- Direct edits to `review.json`, `dry-check.json`, ref-verify caches, or other verdict files.
- Test-obligation verdict caches: they are written only by `bin/sotp test-obligation
  evaluate`, which is an orchestrator-host-owned synchronous repair step in the
  `obligation-fulfillment` workflow — never a fire-and-forget launch or a commit prerequisite
  started by this capability.
- Direct edits to `obligations.json`; it is generated only by `bin/sotp test-obligation derive`.
- Direct commits, staging, pushes, PR edits, or git notes.
- Track state transitions through `bin/sotp track transition`. Only the orchestrator may
  transition a task: it owns the batch lifecycle (it marks `done` after the DRY fix phase and
  before review, so the review sees the final task state, and it backfills the commit hash
  after the batch commit) — a timeline no implementer run can observe.
- Other tracks' artifacts.
- `track/items/<track-id>/batch-plan.json` — the impl-planner capability is its sole writer;
  estimate or batch changes route back through the orchestrator to impl-planner.
- ADR artifacts, and upstream SoT artifacts outside the named correction. For plan-task
  dispatches, spec/type/impl-plan artifacts may be edited only when the assigned task explicitly
  owns them through the appropriate writer workflow. For delegated PR-finding dispatches, a
  briefing is authority only for a named non-ADR correction within the implementer boundary;
  `spec.json`, `<layer>-types.json`, `impl-plan.json`, `task-coverage.json`, `task-contract.json`,
  and `batch-plan.json` remain with their owning writer capabilities. Normal implementation tasks
  should route other upstream changes back to the owning capability.

## Re-entry prerequisite (sequencing discipline)

For a plan-task dispatch, `.harness/policies/sot-reentry-sequencing.md` requires convergence of
the direct upstream: the type catalogues (`catalog_spec` chain: reference signal per
`.harness/config/signal-gates.json`, the applicable `bin/sotp ref-verify` scope, and types-scope
review `zero_findings`) **and** impl-plan-scope review `zero_findings` (the sole tolerated
post-convergence change is a task status transition via `bin/sotp track transition` — a
sequencing-only exception that does not waive the commit gate's mandatory impl-plan review
refresh). A `dispatch_mode: delegated-pr-finding` dispatch is taskless and follows a separate
focused admission path: the focused briefing and current diff identify the requested correction,
so the plan-task Phase 3 and direct-upstream re-entry prerequisites are not reopened for that
dispatch. Before editing, confirm that the named non-ADR correction is within the implementer
boundary and that a focused briefing does not name a writer-owned SoT artifact. For plan-task
dispatches, use the CLI summaries to confirm that Phase 3 planning is present, every TDDD
catalogue is complete, the applicable `catalog_spec` signal and ref-verify findings are
converged, and both the types-scope and impl-plan-scope reviews are `zero_findings`; if those
summaries do not establish admission, return the briefing to the orchestrator without editing.
The focused correction must still be within the implementer boundary.
If a focused briefing names a writer-owned SoT artifact, do not edit it: return it to the owning
phase capability. If a plan-task briefing shows a prerequisite unmet, do not start implementing;
return the briefing to the orchestrator stating the unmet prerequisite. If mid-work you discover
an upstream SoT needs editing, stop immediately and report `blocked` (immediate bounce-back; no
deferred-fix continuation) — this refines the existing rule that upstream changes route back to
the owning capability.

## Internal Pipeline

### Step 1 — Ground The Task

1. Confirm the current branch is `track/<id>`.
2. **Pre-work precondition (task state)**: for plan-task dispatches, confirm every assigned task
   is `in_progress` in `track/items/<id>/impl-plan.json` — the SSoT, **not** the rendered `plan.md`
   view. If any assigned task is not `in_progress`, do not implement anything: return to the
   orchestrator naming the task and asking it to perform the transition (`bin/sotp track transition`
   is the orchestrator's lane). A PR-finding dispatch without assigned task ids instead requires
   the briefing to identify one focused requested correction; do not synthesize a task or change
   task state for that dispatch. This precondition closes the bypass where a plan implementation
   reaches source code without passing the transition path's admission judgment.
3. Read the assigned task descriptions and the cited spec anchors, or the PR finding's cited
   paths and relevant contract anchors.
4. Read the relevant catalogue entries (`<layer>-types.json`) and existing implementation, as
   applicable to the requested change.
5. Check architecture boundaries before introducing or moving types.

### Step 2 — Implement And Test

1. Apply source, test, or review-scope artifact edits matching the assigned task or requested PR
   correction only.
2. Add or update focused tests for new public behavior and failure modes when the correction
   changes behavior; documentation-only corrections use the verification required by their
   briefing.
3. Run focused tests or artifact checks while iterating.
4. For source/test edits, run at least `cargo make ci-rust` before reporting implementation
   completion unless the orchestrator requires full `cargo make ci`; review-scope-only corrections
   use the focused verification required by their briefing. Treat a long-running gate invocation
   as one blocking call and read its terminal result once; if the host backgrounds it, read the
   result once after the single completion notification. Do not poll logs or status, or launch it
   fire-and-forget.

### Step 3 — Author Test-Obligation Bindings When Applicable

For a delegated PR-finding dispatch, skip this step unless the briefing explicitly requests
obligation repair. For plan-task dispatches, run this step when the track already has
`obligations.json` / `test-bindings.json`, when the assigned task creates or changes the
test-obligation gate itself, or when the orchestrator explicitly asks for obligation coverage.

The surrounding orchestration loop (who runs `evaluate`, totality iteration, repair rounds,
file-safety backups, cache semantics) is owned by the `obligation-fulfillment` workflow
(`.harness/workflows/track/obligation-fulfillment.md`); this contract owns the per-record
authoring discipline below. When the host runs `evaluate`, it does so synchronously as one
blocking repair call and reads the terminal result once (or once after a single completion
notification if the host backgrounds it). This capability never launches, polls, or repeats
that evaluation as a commit prerequisite.

1. Run:
   ```
   bin/sotp test-obligation derive
   ```
   This writes `track/items/<track-id>/obligations.json`.
2. Run:
   ```
   bin/sotp test-obligation bindings-skeleton
   ```
   The track resolves from the current `track/<id>` branch; pass `--track-id <track-id>` only
   when running outside the track branch (e.g. detached HEAD during PR review). This prints a
   schema-conformant `test-bindings.json` draft to stdout: every derived obligation id
   pre-filled as a `fulfillment` record with TODO placeholder test locations.
   Do not hand-type obligation ids and do not invent them; the skeleton is the id source.
3. Materialize the skeleton output as `track/items/<track-id>/test-bindings.json` (shell
   redirect, or capture stdout and write it with your file tool), then edit values in place:
   - Replace every TODO test location with a real `layer` / `module_path` / `test_name`.
   - Convert records to the `waiver` / `voluntary_binding` forms where appropriate.
   - Consult `obligations.json` for each obligation's brief and target entry while binding.
   The draft stays rejected by the fail-closed codec until every placeholder is replaced.

   **Triangulate every obligation/edge through BOTH sides before writing or binding a test.**
   The obligation is the join point between the type contract and the behavioral contract:

   1. Follow `target_entry` to the catalogue entry's declaration fragment (what the type
      promises structurally).
   2. Follow the anchor to the spec element's text (what behavior is promised).
   3. The intersection — the part of the anchor's promise that concerns THIS entry's
      declaration — is what the bound tests must verify (fulfillment judgment is edge-local).
   4. Verifier rejection reasons are delta signals against that intersection, never a
      substitute for reading the two sides; repairing from reasons alone converges slowly
      and invites misreadings of spec wording.

   Tests written against the intersection bind first-time; tests written against either side
   alone (only the type's surface, or only the anchor's whole promise) are the primary cause
   of `substitution` / `central_unverified` rejections.
4. Use exactly one of these record forms:
   - `kind: "fulfillment"` with `obligation_id` and non-empty `tests[]`.
   - `kind: "waiver"` with `edge_id` and a human-authored `reason`.
   - `kind: "voluntary_binding"` with `edge_id` and non-empty `tests[]`.
5. Each test location must identify a plain Rust test function by:
   - `layer`
   - `module_path`
   - `test_name`
6. Do not add marker comments to Rust tests.
7. Run:
   ```
   bin/sotp test-obligation check
   ```
   Do not run `bin/sotp test-obligation evaluate` — evaluation is the orchestrator host's
   synchronous repair step in the `obligation-fulfillment` workflow. The host runs one blocking
   call and reads its terminal result once (or once after a single completion notification); it
   never launches evaluation fire-and-forget or as a commit prerequisite. The commit gate runs
   `check`, not `evaluate`.
8. Fix `missing`, `orphaned`, or unresolved findings by updating tests, bindings, or
   routing upstream SoT corrections to the owning capability. The missing/stale-VERDICT
   class is resolved by the host's next synchronous `evaluate` round, not by this capability.

If neither `obligations.json` nor `test-bindings.json` exists, the gate has an empty
existence-based scope and `check` reports zero pairs. If exactly one exists, the scope is
half-materialized and must fail closed.

### Step 4 — Report Completion

Report the implemented task ids or delegated PR finding, changed areas, tests/gates run, and any
remaining blockers to the orchestrator. For a PR finding, include its affected `path:line` and
requested correction in the completion report. The orchestrator decides and performs any
task-state transition; do not stage, commit, or transition tasks.

## Architecture Guard

- Domain types and domain ports stay in `libs/domain/`.
- Usecase interactors and usecase ports stay in `libs/usecase/`.
- Infrastructure adapters stay in `libs/infrastructure/`.
- CLI composition-root wiring stays in `apps/cli-composition/`.
- `apps/cli-driver` is the primary adapter layer.
- The `apps/cli` crate is the bin entry point and should stay thin: parse args, build/dispatch
  through composition, print results, return exit codes.
- Non-code review-scope artifacts may be edited only when they are named by the assigned task or
  delegated PR-finding briefing; they do not authorize unrelated upstream changes.

## Output Contract

Return one of:

| status | meaning |
|---|---|
| `completed` | Assigned tasks or a delegated PR finding, including a review-scope correction, implemented and required tests/gates passed. |
| `blocked` | Implementation cannot proceed without upstream SoT changes, user input, or external state. |
| `failed` | Tooling or verification failed in a way that prevents a reliable implementation handoff. |

Include enough detail for the orchestrator to decide whether to run review, route back to a
writer capability, or stop.

## Rules

- Do not run `git add`, `git commit`, `git push`, or PR commands.
- Do not run `bin/sotp track transition`; report completion to the orchestrator instead.
- Do not edit `review.json` or `dry-check.json` directly.
- Do not edit `obligations.json` directly; generate it with `bin/sotp test-obligation derive`.
- Use `bin/sotp` and `cargo make` wrappers for repository gates.
- Keep edits within the assigned task scope. If a required fix crosses ownership boundaries,
  report it rather than silently expanding scope.

## Session continuity and resume

This capability session is independent of the calling orchestrator's parent session. A
parent-session refresh discards the parent orchestrator's in-memory context; it neither resumes
this capability nor transfers unpersisted implementation reasoning. Source / test or review-scope
artifact edits, test bindings when written, task state, and read-only git state are the durable
hand-off; capability memory is not.

After a parent refresh, the dispatcher must issue a fresh briefing for the current task or PR
finding, carrying the task ids or focused correction, current diff, exact upstream artifact
paths, architecture constraints, and verification requirements. A fresh dispatch, or a dispatch
that changes concern, starts from that briefing. Only an explicit `sotp capability exec
--resume` for the same track and capability continues a capability session. Fresh and resumed
dispatches re-specify every execution flag (model, sandbox, and effort); a failed or expired
resume, or a provider/model mismatch, falls back to a fresh session. On resume, do not trust
carried-over context: first check whether the upstream artifacts of this assignment (`spec.json`,
the type catalogues, `impl-plan.json`, the task briefing, or the current diff) changed, and re-read
every changed input before continuing.
