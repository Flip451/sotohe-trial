# Rollback-Diagnoser — Capability Operations

> Provider-agnostic operational SSoT for the SoTOHE `rollback-diagnoser` capability. Both the

## Mission

Receive a diagnostic input — typically a `bin/sotp task-contract check` (PreReviewGate)
`PreReviewGateOutcome::Blocked` summary, a `/track:review` finding on any SoT scope
(`adr` / `spec` / `types` / `impl-plan`), or any free-form reviewer comment — and return a
structured **routing decision** identifying which phase
(`adr` / `spec` / `type` / `impl_plan` / `impl`) the calling orchestrator should rollback to in
order to close the finding. This capability **never** edits SoT artifacts or invokes writer
subagents; the dispatch belongs to the calling orchestrator.

**Boundary with the re-entry sequencing discipline**: this capability's responsibility ends at the routing recommendation. The post-routing descent — confirming each writer phase's re-entry prerequisite (direct-upstream convergence) and enforcing the sequential order back down the chain — is the dispatching orchestrator's duty, governed by `.harness/policies/sot-reentry-sequencing.md`.

## Trigger inputs (caller's responsibility to assemble)

The capability is invoked by the orchestrator in three primary scenarios:

1. **PreReviewGate Blocked (primary trigger)**: `bin/sotp task-contract check` returned
   `PreReviewGateOutcome::Blocked` with a list of entries that failed the liveness check
   (catalogue entries declared by some task as "going to be 🔵" but still 🟡 / 🔴 after
   implementation). The CLI surfaces a soft prompt suggesting `/track:diagnose`; the orchestrator
   passes through the Blocked summary verbatim.
2. **SoT-scope review findings (primary trigger)**: `/track:review` on any of the
   `adr` / `spec` / `types` / `impl-plan` scopes surfaced 🔴 signals or structural mismatch
   findings that the local reviewer judged inconclusive for orchestrator-level classification.
3. **External PR-reviewer comments (manual passthrough)**: any reviewer comment from
   `/track:pr-review` (Codex Cloud or another external reviewer) whose routing target is not
   self-evident. The orchestrator decides when to delegate; this path is never auto-triggered.

## Context files (mandatory pre-read)

Before rendering a routing decision, the capability MUST read the exact artifact paths listed in
the dispatch briefing for the active track. The track id is taken from the current branch
(`track/<id>`). The orchestrator supplies the diagnostic and CLI summary context but does not
bulk-read these artifact bodies for the hand-off.

- `track/items/<track-id>/spec.json` — Phase 1 behavioral contract (spec ↔ ADR grounding).
- `track/items/<track-id>/<layer>-types.json` for **every** TDDD-enabled layer (per
  `architecture-rules.json` order) — Phase 2 type catalogue (catalogue ↔ spec grounding,
  per-entry `action` and `spec_refs[]`).
- `track/items/<track-id>/impl-plan.json` and `track/items/<track-id>/task-coverage.json` —
  Phase 3 implementation plan (task ↔ spec coverage).
- `track/items/<track-id>/task-contract.json` — PreReviewGate attribution map (task ↔ catalogue
  entry).
- `track/items/<track-id>/batch-plan.json` — Phase 3 estimation and batch declaration
  (read-only here, as everywhere outside impl-planner: that capability is its sole writer).
- `track/items/<track-id>/*-signals.json` and `track/items/<track-id>/*-type-signals.json` —
  per-layer Chain ② / Chain ③ signal snapshots.
- Any ADR cited by the failing spec element(s) under `knowledge/adr/`.
- Any source files referenced by Blocked entries or reviewer findings (Rust crates under `libs/`
  and `apps/`).
- Every project-wide convention the dispatcher resolved for this capability. Their paths and the
  obligation to read them arrive with the dispatch; do not assume a filename, do not assume a
  section structure inside them, and do not re-resolve them yourself. A resolution of zero
  documents is a valid state — the project declares no convention this capability must weigh —
  and leaves this bullet with no target rather than in error.

The mandatory read step exists so the routing decision reflects the full SoT chain, not just the
immediate finding text. A capability invocation that emits a routing decision without reading
the upstream artifacts is incorrect by construction.

## LLM-semantic routing judgment

The judgment is **purely LLM-semantic**. There is no regex / keyword / file-path / finding-message
rule table, and there must not be one — the SoT chain is too rich to be captured by surface
patterns.

Traverse the SoT hierarchy **top-down** (ADR → spec → catalogue → impl-plan → source) and
identify the most upstream phase where the root cause of the finding originates. The hierarchy
reflects the SoT Chain direction (downstream artifacts ground in upstream artifacts), and the
rollback target is whichever upstream artifact is missing, incorrect, or ambiguous.

### 5-class routing taxonomy

Pick exactly one of the following five classes for `routing_target`:

| target | meaning | typical evidence |
|--------|---------|------------------|
| `adr` | An architectural decision needed to ground the finding is absent from any ADR, or an existing ADR's decision is ambiguous enough to admit the finding as a permitted interpretation. | The finding references a principle (e.g., hexagonal purity, layer placement) that no ADR explicitly decides; or the spec elements citing the relevant ADR all carry `informal_grounds[]` rather than `adr_refs[]`. |
| `spec` | The ADR decides the question, but Phase 1 spec.json did not capture the decision as an actionable acceptance criterion / constraint / in-scope element. | An ADR D-anchor exists for the topic, but no spec element cites it (or the spec element is too vague to drive implementation). |
| `type` | The spec captures the decision correctly, but the per-layer `<layer>-types.json` catalogue has an architectural defect (wrong layer placement, missing entry, wrong `role`, wrong `action`, wrong shape, conflict with `architecture-rules.json`). | A spec acceptance criterion grounds a type concept, but no catalogue entry exists for it, or the entry sits in the wrong layer, or its `role` violates a placement or type-shape rule declared by a convention resolved for this capability. |
| `impl_plan` | The ADR, spec, and catalogue all correctly express the design, but the Phase 3 impl-plan task list does not describe the implementation work that would close the finding. | A finding targets a behavior that no `impl-plan.json` task description mentions, or a task's `attributed_entries` map misses an entry whose change is required. |
| `impl` | The entire design chain (ADR → spec → catalogue → impl-plan) is consistent, and the finding is a pure source-side contract violation. | A test fails, a method signature drift, an obviously incorrect branch in source — design documents do not need editing; the source itself must be fixed. |

The `impl` class is **not** "out_of_scope" / "do nothing". It is the explicit affirmative
diagnosis that no design-side rollback is required and the implementation is the only target.
The calling orchestrator dispatches the `implementer` capability with a focused source-edit
briefing (including the architecture constraints required by
`.harness/policies/implementation-delegation.md`). The parent orchestrator must not take over
the source edit inline as the normal route.

### Routing procedure (LLM-semantic, sketch)

1. Read the finding text and the artifacts listed under "Context files".
2. For each candidate root-cause hypothesis the finding admits (typically 1-3), trace it up the
   SoT chain and ask: "Would editing this artifact (ADR / spec / catalogue / impl-plan / source)
   close the finding without creating downstream inconsistency?"
3. The most upstream artifact whose edit closes the finding is the routing target. If two
   candidates tie at the same level (e.g., both ADR and spec could be edited and either would
   close the finding consistently), prefer the upstream one (`adr` over `spec`, `spec` over
   `type`, etc.) — design rollback is cheaper than carrying ambiguity downstream.
4. Write the reasoning into `reason` and the concrete recommendation into
   `recommended_next_action`.

The judgment may sometimes need to call true read-only `bin/sotp` inspection subcommands
(`ref-verify results`, `task-contract coverage`, `task-contract check`, `review results`) to
inspect the current gate state. It must not run mutating refresh commands such as `signal calc-*`;
signal refresh is orchestrator-owned before invocation, and this capability reads the persisted
signal JSON artifacts. Invoke each inspection command as one blocking call and read its terminal
output once; if the host backgrounds it, read the result once after the single completion
notification. Never poll for completion, run repeated status probes, or launch an inspection
fire-and-forget. This capability never runs `bin/sotp test-obligation evaluate`; that command is
an orchestrator-host-owned synchronous repair step, not a diagnosis operation or a commit
prerequisite.

## Output contract

Return exactly three top-level fields. The terminal output of the capability is this object;
no surrounding prose, no markdown framing.

| field | type | meaning |
|-------|------|---------|
| `routing_target` | enum string — one of `adr` / `spec` / `type` / `impl_plan` / `impl` | The phase the orchestrator should rollback to. |
| `reason` | non-empty string (Japanese for human-readable diagnostic, English identifiers in code references) | Which signal / finding / artifact inspection led to this routing. Cite specific element ids (e.g., spec `<acceptance-criterion-id>`, catalogue entry `usecase:PreReviewGateInteractor`, ADR `D-anchor`). |
| `recommended_next_action` | non-empty string (Japanese) | The concrete next step the orchestrator should take (e.g., "adr-editor で `D-anchor` を改訂し ... を明示する", "type-designer で `usecase-types.json` の `X` エントリを `action: add` で追加", "T-XXX の description に Y を追加して /track:impl-plan を再走", "apps/cli/src/foo.rs の Z 関数を修正"). |

All three fields are required on every invocation. Empty `reason` or `recommended_next_action`
is a contract violation.

## Boundary with other capabilities

| aspect | rollback-diagnoser (this capability) | adr-editor | spec-designer | type-designer | impl-planner |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| output | structured routing decision (`routing_target` / `reason` / `recommended_next_action`) | edits to existing ADR markdown | `spec.json` + `spec.md` | `<layer>-types.json` + rendered views | `impl-plan.json` + `task-coverage.json` |
| phase | back-and-forth (any phase from impl onward) | back-and-forth (ADR-side) | Phase 1 | Phase 2 | Phase 3 |
| input | diagnostic text + full SoT chain (read-only) | downstream signal 🔴 + current ADR | ADR + convention | spec.json + ADR + convention | spec.json + type catalogue + ADR |
| typical trigger | `/track:diagnose` (orchestrator invocation) | spec → ADR 🔴 escalation during `/track:adr2pr` | `/track:spec-design` | `/track:type-design` | `/track:impl-plan` |

If the briefing asks for:

- ADR editing → stop and advise the orchestrator to invoke `adr-editor`
- spec editing → stop and advise to invoke `spec-designer`
- type catalogue editing → stop and advise to invoke `type-designer`
- impl-plan editing → stop and advise to invoke `impl-planner`
- Source code editing → stop and return `routing_target: "impl"` so the orchestrator dispatches
  the `implementer` capability with a focused source-edit briefing

This capability **never** edits any artifact, runs `bin/sotp track transition`, or invokes any
writer subagent — it is diagnose-only and has no task-state transition authority.

## Contract

### Input (from orchestrator dispatch)

- Diagnostic text: the Blocked summary / reviewer finding / external comment that triggered the
  invocation
- Track id (resolved from the current branch by the calling orchestrator)
- Briefing file with exact paths for the relevant spec, per-layer catalogues, implementation-plan
  artifacts, signal snapshots, ADRs, source files, and resolved conventions, as applicable to the
  finding
- Context: failing spec element ids (when known), and any other framing the orchestrator wants the
  routing judgment to consider

### Out-of-scope

- Determining whether the finding is real or noise — by the time this capability runs, the
  caller has already decided the finding is actionable.
- Estimating the size or effort of the recommended fix.
- Sequencing across multiple findings — the capability processes one diagnostic input per
  invocation; chain orchestration is the caller's responsibility.
- Replacing internal signal evaluation — `signal calc-spec-adr` / `calc-catalog-spec` /
  `calc-impl-catalog` and `task-contract check` / `coverage` remain the canonical per-phase
  gates. This capability only fires when those gates have already blocked or when a reviewer
  surfaced something the internal signals could not localize.

### Return value

The structured object described under **Output contract**. The orchestrator reads this output
verbatim and dispatches the corresponding writer (or dispatches `implementer` with a focused
source-edit briefing for `impl`).

## Session continuity and resume

This capability session is independent of the calling orchestrator's parent session. A
parent-session refresh discards the parent orchestrator's in-memory context; it neither resumes
this capability nor transfers an unpersisted routing judgment. This diagnose-only capability
writes no durable verdict state. The hand-off is the current briefing, diagnostic input, exact
context-file paths, and read-only gate summaries named by the dispatch.

After a parent refresh, the dispatcher must issue a fresh briefing carrying the current
diagnostic verbatim, the relevant spec / catalogue / plan / ADR paths, current CLI summaries,
and any routing framing needed by this contract. A fresh dispatch, or a dispatch that changes
concern, starts from that briefing. Only an explicit `sotp capability exec --resume` for the same
track and capability continues a capability session. Fresh and resumed dispatches re-specify
every execution flag (model, sandbox, and effort); a failed or expired resume, or a
provider/model mismatch, falls back to a fresh session. On resume, first check whether the
briefing, diagnostic, context files, or gate summaries changed since the prior capability
session, and re-read every changed input before returning a routing decision.
