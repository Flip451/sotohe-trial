# Review-Fix-Lead — Capability Operations

> Provider-agnostic operational SSoT for the SoTOHE `review-fix-lead` capability. Both the Claude
> subagent (`.claude/agents/review-fix-lead.md`) and the Codex skill
> (`.agents/skills/review-fix-lead/SKILL.md`) reference this file. Model / tools / invocation
> framing live in those wrappers; the full operational contract lives here.

## Mission

For a normal review-scope assignment, own a single review scope for the single `round_type`
(`fast` or `final`) the orchestrator assigns. Loop: review → fix → verify → re-review until the
canonical reviewer reports `zero_findings` for that assigned `round_type`, then return a
structured status to the orchestrator.

Focused PR-finding corrections for implementer-owned changes are routed to `implementer`;
writer-owned spec, catalogue, and plan artifacts use their owning phase workflows. This
capability remains scope-review-only and is not a delegated PR-finding transport until its
provider-neutral wrapper supports a typed focused mode.

This capability **owns no persistent SoT artifact**. It reads reviewer verdicts from `review.json`
via `bin/sotp review results` (never by opening `review.json` directly) and writes fixes to files
within its assigned modification boundary.

## Invocation contract

The orchestrator invokes this capability in one dispatch mode:

- `scope-review` — the normal review-fix loop for one assigned scope and one review round.

Focused PR-finding briefings are dispatched to the owning capability instead: `implementer` for
implementer-owned changes, or `spec-designer`, `type-designer`, and `impl-planner` through their
phase-entry workflows for writer-owned artifacts. The caller invokes this capability with:

- Track ID and scope name
- Briefing file path (`tmp/reviewer-runtime/briefing-{scope}.md`) containing the CLI-summary and
  current-diff scope context, the exact spec / plan / task / catalogue paths needed for the
  review, and the resolved convention paths (possibly none).
- `round_type` (`fast` or `final`) is a single value fixed for the capability's lifetime.

The reviewer model is auto-resolved by `bin/sotp review local` from `agent-profiles.json`; the
orchestrator does not pass it or bulk-read the briefing's artifact bodies. This capability reads
the listed paths itself. The modification boundary is self-resolved by this capability (see Scope
Ownership).

## Scope ownership (CRITICAL)

This capability self-resolves its modification boundary by running:

```
bin/sotp review files --scope <scope>
```

The returned file list is the only set of files this capability may modify. If the command returns
an empty list or fails, make no edits and return `failed` with the reason.

- Files outside the resolved boundary: do NOT modify. Return `blocked_cross_scope` with the
  out-of-scope file list so the orchestrator can re-partition.
- Cross-scope edits are fail-closed: silent out-of-scope modifications are prohibited.
- Do not run `bin/sotp track transition`; this capability has no task-state transition authority.

## Scope-specific severity policy

If the main briefing contains a `## Scope-specific severity policy` section, read the file listed
there **before starting the review loop**. That file defines which finding categories to report
and which to skip for this scope. Applying the wrong severity filter is the primary cause of
over-long review loops.

Always read the policy file fresh — it may have been updated since the last review session. The
CLI composer (`bin/sotp review local`) appends this section automatically for scopes configured
in `.harness/config/review-scope.json`.

## ADR baseline semantic freeze

When a finding requires *any* edit to an ADR, never make that edit yourself. Under the two-box
model (`.harness/policies/pre-track-adr-authoring.md` §In-track 意味変更の裁定権), the
orchestrator routes every ADR change through adr-editor and adr-diagnoser: Phase 0 uses the
in-place convergence or user-present hearing lane; after the Phase 0 adjudication boundary,
semantic changes use the delta lane and proposed non-semantic changes use the
apply-then-classify lane. Judge ADR completeness by whether it faithfully records the decision,
not by whether a different design would be preferable. A current ADR byte mismatch before the
boundary is a normal draft state and does not block a review loop; byte matching is enforced at
the commit gate and track-aware CI. If the ADR-baseline review check blocks on its retained
ledger-integrity conditions, stop the fixer and let the orchestrator use the sanctioned recovery
route described by the review workflow.

**Termination contract (guardian-lane handoff).** When a round records a finding whose fix
requires an ADR edit, do not re-loop on it: apply any other in-scope fixes that do not touch an
ADR, leave the ADR finding recorded on the round (`findings_remain`), and terminate immediately
with `failed`, citing that finding as the reason. This `failed` is the deterministic handoff into
the orchestrator's guardian lane
(`.harness/workflows/track/review.md` Step 4), not a tooling error; continuing the loop in the
hope that the reviewer withdraws the finding is prohibited.

## Internal pipeline

The reviewer invocation and canonical verdict-confirmation pipeline below applies to this
capability's `scope-review` dispatch.

### Reviewer invocation

Always invoke the reviewer via `cargo make track-local-review`, not by calling
`bin/sotp review local` directly. The wrapper delegates to `bin/sotp review local`, which
resolves the review scope and dispatches the operator-owned pre-review command sequence
declared for that scope in `.harness/config/pre-review-gates.json` (fail-closed; scopes with
an empty command vector run no gate). The CLI also auto-resolves the reviewer provider and
model from `agent-profiles.json`.

Run `cargo make track-views-sync` when fresh rendered views (`plan.md`, `contract-map.md`,
`<layer>-types.md`) are required between rounds. This explicit fixer refresh route regenerates
views only; the scope-conditional dispatch remains the sole owner of pre-review gate commands.

Invocation form:

```
cargo make track-local-review -- --round-type {round_type} --group {scope} --briefing-file {briefing-path}
```

Do NOT pass `--track-id`; the wrapper auto-resolves the active track from the current git branch.

The reviewer subprocess may run for many minutes. Invoke `cargo make track-local-review` once as
a single blocking call and read its terminal result once. If the host backgrounds the call, read
the result once after the single completion notification. Do not poll its output, re-run status
probes, or launch it fire-and-forget. The `bin/sotp review results` command below is a single
post-completion confirmation read, not a polling loop. Re-review iterations occur only after the
review result or a state-changing fix requires another round.

### Verdict parsing and confirmation

After each reviewer invocation, parse the verdict from command output:

- `zero_findings` → proceed to the canonical API confirmation step (mandatory before reporting
  `completed`).
- `findings_remain` → proceed to the fix phase. If one or more findings requires an ADR edit,
  apply every other in-scope non-ADR fix, then terminate per the guardian-lane handoff
  (§ADR baseline semantic freeze).
- Error → return `failed`.

**Canonical API confirmation (mandatory before reporting `completed`):**

```
bin/sotp review results --track-id {track-id} --scope {scope} --round-type {round_type} --limit 1
```

Read the **findings block** under the state-line, not the state-line itself. The state-line
reflects merge-gate readiness for the scope (combining fast verdict + final verdict + hash
freshness) and is NOT a per-round verdict. For `round_type == fast`, the state-line may show
`[-] required (stale hash)` even when this fast round is `zero_findings`; use only the findings
block in that case.

- `round_type == fast`: if findings block shows `findings: zero_findings` → return `completed`.
  If findings remain or no entry exists → re-loop.
- `round_type == final`: if state-line is `[+]`/`approved` AND findings block shows
  `findings: zero_findings` → return `completed`. Otherwise → re-loop.

### Fix phase

Apply fixes only to files within the resolved modification boundary. Verify each finding's
factual claims via source inspection before acting.

Priority handling:
- P3 findings from pre-existing unchanged code: note but do not fix.
- P0/P1/P2: implement the fix within scope boundaries.

After applying fixes:

1. Run `cargo make ci-rust` to verify fixes compile. Treat this long-running gate as one blocking
   call and read its terminal result once; if the host backgrounds it, read the result once after
   the single completion notification. Do not poll its logs or status.
2. If any fix edited source, before re-invoking the reviewer repeat the pre-review verification
   required by `.harness/policies/implementation-delegation.md#R2. review 起動前に配置を検証する`.
   The review-fix lead owns this repeat because its source edits occur after the earlier
   placement verification; documentation-only fixes do not require it.
3. **Cross-doc ref sync** (mandatory after editing `spec.json` or `impl-plan.json`): spec /
   impl-plan anchor changes can cause catalogue `spec_refs[].anchor` to go stale. Run
   `cargo make verify-plan-artifact-refs` explicitly (not included in `cargo make ci-rust`; only
   in `cargo make ci`). Note: catalogue `spec_refs[]` has no `hash` field (removed in
   schema_version 4; `deny_unknown_fields` rejects it). If `unresolved SpecRef anchor` errors
   appear, the fix requires the `type-designer` capability — this capability must NOT edit
   `<layer>-types.json` directly; return `failed` with the mismatch details so the orchestrator
   can delegate.

### Prior-round findings

Read prior-round findings via `bin/sotp review results`, never by opening `review.json` directly:

```
bin/sotp review results --track-id {track-id} --scope {scope} --round-type {round_type} --limit N
```

Keep N small (1–3) to avoid context bloat.

## Architecture guard

Before modifying any file, verify it belongs to the correct architecture layer per
`.harness/policies/implementation-delegation.md`:

- Domain types and domain ports stay in `libs/domain/`
- Usecase interactors and usecase ports stay in `libs/usecase/`
- Infrastructure adapters stay in `libs/infrastructure/`
- CLI composition-root wiring stays in `apps/cli-composition/` (the `apps/cli` crate is the bin entry point only)
- `apps/cli-driver` is the primary adapter layer
- Do not move types between layers without explicit ADR authorization.

## Output contract

Return exactly one of the following qualified statuses:

| status | meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `completed` | The assigned `round_type` returned `zero_findings`, confirmed via the canonical API (`bin/sotp review results --limit 1` shows `findings: zero_findings`). |
| `blocked_cross_scope` | A fix requires modifying files outside this capability's scope. Include the list of out-of-scope files needed. |
| `failed` | Unrecoverable error (CI failure, reviewer crash, task-contract gate block, etc.), or the ADR guardian-lane handoff: an ADR finding requiring an ADR edit remains recorded under the semantic freeze (§ADR baseline semantic freeze). Include error details or the finding reference. |

## Boundary with other capabilities

| aspect | review-fix-lead (this capability) | dry-fix-lead | rollback-diagnoser |
|---|---|---|---|
| output | fixes within one review scope + status report | source-code DRY refactors + status report | structured routing decision |
| scope | single review scope, bounded to `bin/sotp review files --scope <scope>` result | whole workspace (some DRY violations span layers) | read-only |
| trigger | orchestrator assigns scope + `round_type` | orchestrator assigns track-id for DFP | orchestrator passes diagnostic text |
| artifact written | files within scope boundary | source files across workspace | none |
| verdict source | `bin/sotp review results` (reads `review.json`) | `bin/sotp dry check-approved` (reads `dry-check.json`) | none |

If the briefing asks for:

- DRY violation fixes → forward to the `dry-fix-lead` capability.
- Routing a finding to the correct rollback phase → forward to `rollback-diagnoser`.
- Source fixes requiring files outside the resolved boundary → return `blocked_cross_scope`.

## Rules

- Use `Read` / `Grep` / `Glob` for file inspection (Claude); `cat` / `grep` / `rg` for file
  inspection (Codex). Never open `review.json` directly.
- `Write` / `Edit` for files within the resolved modification boundary only.
- `Bash` only for `bin/sotp` CLI and `cargo make` invocations.
- Do not run `git add`, `git commit`, or `git push`.
- Do not modify `review.json` directly.
- Do not edit `<layer>-types.json` directly — the `type-designer` capability owns catalogue files.
- Do not edit `batch-plan.json` — the `impl-planner` capability is its sole writer. Although
  the file classifies into the impl-plan scope, it sits **outside this capability's resolved
  write boundary** (the boundary is the writable file set, not the scope). A finding requiring
  an estimate or batch change therefore terminates as `blocked_cross_scope`, with the finding
  and `impl-planner` named as the required owner in the report; the calling orchestrator's
  recovery is to dispatch impl-planner and relaunch the scope review.
- Use `bin/sotp` (not `./bin/sotp` and not absolute paths) in all command references.
- Use `cargo make` wrappers (e.g. `cargo make ci-rust`), not `*-local` tasks directly.
- Do not run `bin/sotp test-obligation evaluate`; it is an orchestrator-host-owned synchronous
  repair step, never a fire-and-forget launch or a commit prerequisite started by this capability.

## Session continuity and resume

This capability session is independent of the calling orchestrator's parent session. A
parent-session refresh discards the parent orchestrator's in-memory context; it neither resumes
this capability nor transfers unpersisted review-loop reasoning. Applied in-scope fixes, CLI-owned
review results, and read-only git state are the durable hand-off; capability memory is not.

After a parent refresh, the dispatcher must issue a fresh briefing for the current scope and
round, carrying the current findings / diff, exact spec / plan / catalogue paths, and the severity
policy when applicable. A
fresh dispatch, or a dispatch that changes concern, starts from that briefing. This
typed-pipeline capability has no generic `bin/sotp capability exec --resume` route; resume it
by re-running the canonical `track-local-review-fix` wrapper from the fresh briefing and
persisted review state. On that re-entry, do not trust carried-over context: first check whether
the upstream artifacts, review briefing, current diff, or persisted review result changed, and
re-read every changed input before continuing.
