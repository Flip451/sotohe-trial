# CLI (Thin-Bin) Layer Review: Severity Policy

The reviewer's role is **thin-bin boundary review** of `apps/cli/`
(`src/main.rs` and `src/commands/*.rs`). The bin layer does exactly three things:
parse arguments into typed `Input` structs, obtain a wired Driver from
`cli_composition`, and call `driver.handle(input)` to receive a `CommandOutcome`
which it emits (stdout/stderr + `ExitCode`). It must not contain business logic,
perform direct I/O for application purposes, or import from `usecase`/`domain`
directly. Cite `architecture-rules.json` when reporting a dependency-direction
violation.

## Priority categories

Violations of the role statement above are always reportable. The following priority categories focus the review and guide severity assessment; they are not an exhaustive list of reportable design deviations. The exclusions in **What NOT to report** still apply:

- **external-boundary assumptions**: What external boundaries does the diff touch (OS, process, encoding, concurrency, resource limits, time, and other versions of its own artifacts)? Enumerate operations directly reached from the changed behavior. If a depended-on assumption is in neither the spec nor the environment-assumption declaration the project owns (the convention listed under `Current Files` in `knowledge/conventions/README.md` whose purpose is declaring environment assumptions; resolve it through that index, not a fixed filename), report it as `未宣言の前提への依存`; treat unresolvable indirect boundaries the same way rather than searching exhaustively.
- **business logic in bin**: a calculation, branching decision, domain
  transformation, or multi-step orchestration in `src/main.rs` or a
  `src/commands/*.rs` handler. The handler must be a thin parse-dispatch-emit
  wrapper. Computations that belong in `usecase` or `domain` must not be
  inlined here. Name the computation and the layer that owns it.
- **direct I/O in bin**: production code in `apps/cli/` that writes to `stdout`
  / files / the network for application purposes (e.g., telemetry persistence via
  `std::fs` / `serde_json` / `chrono::Utc::now()` inlined in `main.rs`).
  Permitted: `eprintln!` for fatal startup errors before a Driver is available,
  and `emit(outcome)` which routes `CommandOutcome.stdout` / `.stderr` to the
  appropriate streams. Application-level I/O must flow through a Driver.
- **usecase/domain import in production**: non-test code in `apps/cli/` that
  imports from `usecase::*` or `domain::*` directly (bypassing `cli_composition`
  or `cli_driver` re-exports). The bin's only knowledge of the application must
  come through `cli_composition::*` (wiring) and `cli_driver::*` (typed Inputs /
  `CommandOutcome`). Test-only imports (`#[cfg(test)]`) are excluded. Cite
  `architecture-rules.json` (`cli` may depend only on `cli_composition` and
  `cli_driver`).
- **driver coordinate in bin violated**: a command handler that invokes a
  use-case interactor directly (bypassing both `cli_composition::*CompositionRoot`
  and `cli_driver::*Driver`). Argument parsing should produce a typed `Input`; the
  bin calls `driver.handle(input)` and emits the `CommandOutcome`.
- **ExitCode mapping inconsistency**: a command that on the unhappy path prints
  an error but returns `ExitCode::SUCCESS` (or vice-versa). Scripted callers
  will misinterpret the result.
- **inconsistent output for `--json` / `--quiet` flag**: a command that ignores
  its own output-mode flag, or emits diagnostics to stdout instead of stderr
  (breaks piped consumption).

## What NOT to report

- Subcommand naming (`--scope` vs `--group`) when the existing name is documented
  in `.claude/commands/` or `README.md`
- `clap` derive vs builder — both are valid project styles
- Output color / formatting choices that do not affect correctness or flag
  consistency
- "You could use `?` here" suggestions when the surrounding code uses an explicit
  `match` for context attachment
- Restructuring the `commands/` directory layout
- Help-text wording suggestions
- `unwrap()` / `expect()` inside `#[cfg(test)]` blocks
