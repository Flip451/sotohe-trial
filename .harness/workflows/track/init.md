# Init Workflow SSoT

> Provider-agnostic workflow SSoT for the `init` track workflow. Both the Claude adapter
> (`.claude/commands/track/init.md`) and the Codex skill adapter
> (`.agents/skills/track-init/SKILL.md`) reference this file. Provider-specific invocation
> framing lives in those adapters; the full workflow contract lives here.

## Mission

Initialize a new track directory and its branch (Phase 0). Creates the minimal identity
artifacts — `track/items/<track-id>/metadata.json` and its rendered views — and materializes
the branch from the configured base branch (`.harness/config/branch-strategy.json#base_branch`).
Phase 0 is the precondition for every subsequent phase; no planning or implementation may
proceed until this workflow completes with OK.

## Inputs

- **Feature name** — a slug-ready phrase or descriptive string; the caller supplies this as the
  primary argument. A calling workflow may have resolved it from conversation context under its
  own user-confirmed input contract, but it always arrives here as an explicit value. If
  absent, the caller must ask the user for a feature name and stop.
- **Primary ADR source filename** — the orchestrator supplies the direct Markdown filename under
  `knowledge/adr/` to create this track's Phase-0 init designation record. It is
  context-dependent and must not be derived by this workflow; a calling workflow may have
  resolved it from conversation context under its own user-confirmed input contract, but it
  always arrives here as an explicit value. After the stamp succeeds, the ledger init record is
  the designation and no separate primary pointer is retained.
- **Current branch = configured base branch** — the workflow requires the working tree to be on
  the branch named by `.harness/config/branch-strategy.json#base_branch` before branch creation.
  Any other starting branch is a hard prerequisite failure.
- **Git status** — expected clean, or containing only ADR / convention files that belong to
  this new track and will be committed inside it. Any unrelated in-progress changes must be
  resolved by the user before the workflow proceeds.

## Sequence

**Step 1: Pre-flight check**

Verify the current git branch matches the configured base branch
(`.harness/config/branch-strategy.json#base_branch`). If not, stop and present the situation to
the user — do not auto-switch. Check `git status --short`:

- ADR / convention / other `knowledge/` baseline files staged for the new track: already
  resolved — they will be committed inside the new track. No user action required.
- Other unrelated in-progress changes: present the list and ask the user whether to commit,
  stash, discard, or split into a separate track. Do not auto-act.

Proceed to Step 2 once the branch matches the configured base branch and any unrelated changes
are resolved.

**Step 2: Create track branch**

Derive `<track-id>` from the feature name as `<YYYY-MM-DD>-<feature-slug>`: obtain the date
prefix from `date -u +"%Y-%m-%d"`, convert the feature name to a kebab-case ASCII slug, and
concatenate them in that order. For example, on 2026-07-31 the feature slug `example-track`
derives `2026-07-31-example-track`. Then create and switch to the track branch:

```
bin/sotp track branch create --items-dir track/items '<track-id>'
```

**Step 3: Create metadata.json**

Write `track/items/<track-id>/metadata.json` with the following fields:

- `schema_version`: 6
- `id`: `<track-id>`
- `title`: human-readable title derived from the feature name
- `branch`: `track/<track-id>`
- `created_at` / `updated_at`: `date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ"` (no manual input)
- `branch_strategy_snapshot`: copy `base_branch`, `merge_target`, and `merge_method` from
  `.harness/config/branch-strategy.json` at creation time. This snapshot is immutable for the
  track lifetime and is the source for post-init branch operations.

**Step 4: Render views**

Regenerate `plan.md` and `track/registry.md` from `metadata.json`:

```
bin/sotp track views sync
```

A warning about `contract-map.md` skipping the new track (because the first TDDD-enabled
layer's `<layer>-types.json` — as declared by the first `tddd.enabled` layer in
`architecture-rules.json` — does not exist yet) is expected at this phase and is not an error.

**Step 5: Create the primary ADR init designation record**

After metadata and views exist, create the primary-ADR designation through the dedicated
mechanism (never by copying files or editing the ledger):

```
bin/sotp adr-baseline snapshot --source '<primary-adr-file>.md' --kind init
```

This records the working-tree bytes as an append-only init baseline for the active track; the
ledger init record itself is the primary designation. A missing or invalid filename is an ERROR;
do not continue without that designation record.

**Step 6: Verify identity schema**

```
cargo make verify-track-metadata
```

This gate must pass (exit 0) before the workflow reports success.

**Step 7: (Optional) ADR baseline commit**

When ADR / convention files prepared for this track are present in the working tree without
commit history, the recommended flow is to commit them as the first commit of the new track
immediately after Step 5, via the `review` workflow followed by the `commit` workflow
(see `.harness/workflows/track/review.md` and `.harness/workflows/track/commit.md`). At this
point `metadata.json` (Step 3) and `plan.md` (Step 4) exist; `spec.md` is created later in
Phase 1 and is not required for this first commit.

## Gates

| Step | Gate | Verdict |
|------|------|---------|
| 1 | Current branch is the configured base branch; no unrelated dirty state | ERROR → stop |
| 5 | `bin/sotp adr-baseline snapshot --source <primary-adr-file> --kind init` exits 0 | OK / ERROR |
| 6 | `cargo make verify-track-metadata` exits 0 | OK / ERROR |

The workflow completes with **OK** when `verify-track-metadata` passes.
It completes with **ERROR** on any hard failure (base branch mismatch, branch creation failure,
metadata write failure, or gate failure). On ERROR, stop and report to the caller.

## Failure / recovery

- **Base branch mismatch**: report the current branch and available options (switch to the
  configured base branch manually, or abort). Do not auto-switch.
- **Unrelated dirty state**: list the modified files, classify them, and ask the user for a
  resolution action.
- **Branch creation failure** (`bin/sotp track branch create` non-zero): report the error.
  A pre-existing branch with the same name is the most common cause; adjust the track-id slug
  or rename the existing branch.
- **ADR baseline snapshot failure**: report the command error and correct the orchestrator-supplied
  primary ADR filename; do not create a ledger or copy manually.
- **verify-track-metadata failure**: report the schema validation errors from the command output.
  Fix `metadata.json` fields accordingly and re-run the gate.

## Outputs

- `track/items/<track-id>/` directory (created)
- `track/items/<track-id>/metadata.json` (written, schema_version 6 with
  `branch_strategy_snapshot`)
- `track/items/<track-id>/plan.md` (rendered view; do not edit directly)
- `track/registry.md` (regenerated; gitignored, not committed)
- Branch `track/<track-id>` (created and checked out)
- `track/items/<track-id>/adr-baseline/` init ledger entry and verbatim baseline copy
- Gate verdict reported to the caller: **OK** or **ERROR** + error details
- No commit is created by this workflow (Step 7 is optional and delegates to other workflows)
