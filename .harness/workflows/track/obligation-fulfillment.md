# Obligation-Fulfillment Workflow SSoT

> Provider-agnostic workflow SSoT for driving a track's test-obligation gate from derived
> obligations to a green `check`. The `implement` workflow (Step 4) and the `full-cycle`
> workflow delegate here for every track holding at least one TDDD catalogue — such a track
> is already enrolled by the `type-design` workflow's mandatory terminal derive step;
> enrollment is never decided here. The workflow may also be run
> standalone to close the gate on an existing track. Authoring rules for individual binding
> records live in the `implementer` capability contract
> (`.harness/capabilities/implementer.md` Step 3) — this workflow owns the ORCHESTRATION
> loop, not the per-record discipline, and must not duplicate it.

## Mission

Bring `bin/sotp test-obligation check` to exit 0 for the current track: every derived
obligation bound, every ref edge resolved (tests or waiver), and every resolving verdict
fresh under the current hash triples and verifier fingerprint. The loop is a cooperation
between the **implementer capability** (authors `test-bindings.json` and tests) and the
**orchestrator host** (owns running `evaluate`; the provider-specific sandbox rationale and
launch constraints live in the provider adapters).

## Timing (read first)

- **Canonical point: immediately after Phase 2 (type-design).** `derive`'s inputs
  (catalogues, spec, rules) are fixed there. Deriving early lets implementers write tests
  AGAINST named obligations (briefs in hand), grow bindings incrementally per batch, and pay
  per-batch evaluation costs of minutes. Commit `obligations.json` together with a valid
  (possibly records-empty) `test-bindings.json` so the artifact scope is fully materialized.
- **Retro-fit (post-implementation) is the degenerate mode**: expect a large cold evaluation,
  a high first-pass rejection rate (tests were not written against obligations), and several
  repair loops. Use it only when the gate arrives on an already-implemented track.

## Inputs

- Current `track/<id>` branch.
- `track/items/<id>/obligations.json` and a (possibly records-empty)
  `test-bindings.json` — both materialized by the `type-design` workflow's terminal derive
  step; their absence on a catalogue-bearing track is a fail-closed `check` failure, not a
  state this workflow silently repairs — plus the track's catalogues + `spec.json`
  (triangulation sources).
- **Capability and verifier routing** — `bin/sotp capability exec` resolves the implementer
  profile internally from `.harness/config/agent-profiles.json`; `bin/sotp test-obligation
  evaluate` resolves its verifier profiles internally from the same routing SSoT.

## Sequence

**Step 1: Re-derive on upstream change.** `obligations.json` already exists (type-design
terminal derive). Run `bin/sotp test-obligation derive` (active track branch required) again
only when catalogues / spec / rules changed since the last derivation, so the obligations
reflect the current upstream. Never hand-edit the artifact.

**Step 2: Skeleton (first enrollment only).** The enrollment artifact already exists for a
normal run. Do not regenerate or overwrite it: its existing fulfillment and waiver records
are the batch's incremental authoring history. If a sanctioned recovery has created a missing
bindings artifact, run `bin/sotp test-obligation bindings-skeleton` into a scratch file and
use that schema-pure draft (every obligation id as a `fulfillment` record with TODO test
locations) only as the initial authoring input; validate it before its first materialization.

**Step 3: Author (implementer capability).** Delegate binding authoring to the `implementer`
capability. Its contract owns the record forms, the canonical waiver shapes, and the
**triangulation discipline** (declaration × anchor → entry-relevant intersection). Briefings
must point at the capability contract instead of restating it.

**File-safety discipline (mandatory for every editing round):** copy the current
`test-bindings.json` to a scratch backup before edits; edit a scratch copy; validate JSON;
only then replace the real artifact. A corrupted bindings file is expensive to reconstruct
(it is untracked until the closing commit).

**Step 4: Totality loop (deterministic, sandbox-safe).** Run `bin/sotp test-obligation
check`; it enumerates unresolved edges and existence drifts. The implementer resolves every
edge (`voluntary_binding` with real tests, or a canonical waiver) and repeats until the only
remaining failure class is missing/stale verdicts — that class belongs to Step 5.

**Step 5: Synchronous repair evaluation (orchestrator host).**
`bin/sotp test-obligation evaluate` verifies fulfillment/waiver pairs via the routed LLM
verifiers and freezes verdicts into the caches. The orchestrator invokes it only as the
synchronous evaluation step for the current repair round: run one blocking call, then read its
terminal result once. If the host backgrounds the call, read the result once after the single
completion notification. Never launch it in the background or fire-and-forget, and do not poll
for completion or run repeated status probes. The commit gate runs `check`, not `evaluate`.
Cache semantics governing the loop:

- Verdicts freeze per hash triple; only pairs whose content changed re-verify (cost scales
  with the edit set, not the pair universe).
- Each verdict carries the verifier-prompt fingerprint; a judge/prompt update automatically
  invalidates mismatched entries — never delete or hand-edit the cache files.
- The run includes calibration probes across the three fulfillment-fail categories; a
  calibration failure means the VERIFIER is unhealthy (stop and fix routing/prompt — do not
  "repair" bindings against a broken judge).

**Step 6: Repair loop (reason-driven, triangulation-first).** While `check` still fails:

1. Read each failing pair's cached rejection reason (fulfillment / waiver cache entries).
2. Re-triangulate the edge (capability contract discipline); the reason is a delta signal
   against the entry-relevant intersection, not a substitute for reading both sides.
3. Repair: bind additional existing tests (multi-test records are the norm for multi-branch
   promises), write a focused test where nothing covers the intersection, or convert the
   record to the honest form (canonical waiver ⇄ fulfillment/voluntary) when the prior form
   was wrong for the edge.
4. Re-run Step 5 synchronously (diff-only), then `check`. Converge to exit 0.

Keep exactly ONE writer editing `test-bindings.json` per round (no parallel binding editors);
parallelism belongs inside `evaluate`, not in authoring.

## Gates

| Step | Gate | Verdict |
|------|------|---------|
| 4 | `check` reports only the missing/stale-verdict class | proceed to 5 / keep resolving |
| 5 | `evaluate` completes (calibration healthy) | proceed / stop: verifier unhealthy |
| 6 | `bin/sotp test-obligation check` exits 0 | done / loop |

## Failure / recovery

- **Transient provider errors during evaluate** (capacity / rate-limit / launcher races):
  the subprocess runner retries with backoff internally; on a run-level abort, simply re-run
  `evaluate` — frozen verdicts make retries cheap.
- **Calibration failure**: verifier health problem. Check provider/model routing and the
  verifier prompts; after a judge fix, re-run `evaluate` — fingerprint mismatch re-opens
  affected verdicts automatically.
- **Suspected judge misbehavior** (e.g. demands crossing edge-locality): treat as a
  production defect of the verifier prompt, fix via the normal implementation path, and let
  the fingerprint invalidation propagate it. Do not game bindings to satisfy a broken judge.
- **Corrupted `test-bindings.json`**: restore from the round backup (file-safety discipline).
  Last resort: regenerate via Step 2 and re-author — verdict caches survive and any pair
  whose content matches re-attaches without re-verification.
- **Missing enrollment artifacts on a catalogue-bearing existing track**: stop before
  authoring and route the track through the `type-design` workflow's mandatory terminal derive
  step (or its sanctioned migration route). Do not create the artifacts ad hoc in this
  workflow; after that route completes, resume this workflow with both artifacts present.
- **Genuine upstream gaps** (obligation impossible to fulfill or waive honestly): route to
  the owning writer capability (catalogue → type-designer, spec → spec-designer, ADR →
  adr-editor) instead of forcing a binding.

## Constraints

1. `evaluate` is host-owned: only the orchestrator host runs it, never a delegated
   authoring round. The provider-specific sandbox rationale and launch mechanics live in
   the adapter documents (`.agents/skills/track-obligation-fulfillment/SKILL.md`,
   `.claude/commands/track/obligation-fulfillment.md`). All other gate subcommands
   (`derive` on-branch, `check`, `results`, `bindings-skeleton`) may run in delegated
   rounds.
2. Verdict caches are never hand-edited or deleted; validity is governed by hash triples +
   verifier fingerprints (fail-closed).
3. `results` is informational (exit 0); the only pass/fail authority is `check`.

## Outputs

- `track/items/<id>/test-bindings.json` (implementer-authored, committed with the batch)
- `track/items/<id>/obligation-fulfillment-cache.json` / `waiver-cache.json` (frozen verdicts)
- `check` exit 0 — the commit gate's test-obligation precondition holds
- Round metrics worth reporting: per-lane pass/fail counts per round, edit-set sizes,
  evaluation wall-clock (cache-hit ratio evidence)
