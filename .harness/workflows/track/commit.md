# Commit Workflow SSoT

> Provider-agnostic workflow SSoT for the `commit` track workflow. Both the Claude adapter
> (`.claude/commands/track/commit.md`) and the Codex skill adapter
> (`.agents/skills/track-commit/SKILL.md`) reference this file. Provider-specific invocation
> framing lives in those adapters; the full workflow contract lives here.

## Mission

Stage the working tree, create a guarded commit from the current track branch, and attach a
structured git note for traceability. The commit is protected by the `cargo make track-commit-message`
wrapper, which runs full CI (`cargo make ci`), track-aware gates (`cargo make ci-track`),
including the ADR-baseline commit check, review/ref-verify approvals, the test-obligation
fulfillment gate, and the DRY gate before
writing the commit. Commits from non-track branches are rejected (fail-closed). The canonical staging order is:
implement → review → stage → commit. Staging before the final review round silently omits the
`review.json` delta from the commit, producing a stale artifact on disk.

## Inputs

- **Commit message** — supplied by the caller. If absent, the workflow generates 2-3 candidates
  from current track context and presents them for the user to choose; no guarded commit is
  executed in the proposal phase.
- **Current branch** — must match `track/<id>`. Commits from non-track branches are rejected.
- **Staged diff** — must be non-empty and must cover the intended commit scope. If `review.json`
  shows modified-but-unstaged in `git status`, the caller staged before the final review round
  and must re-stage now.
- **`bin/sotp review check-approved` exit 0** — required before the guarded commit wrapper
  proceeds (the wrapper enforces this gate internally via `cargo make track-commit-message`).
- **`bin/sotp test-obligation check` exit 0** — required before the guarded commit wrapper
  proceeds; missing bindings, unresolved edges, or stale verdicts block the commit.
- **`bin/sotp dry check-approved` exit 0** — required before the guarded commit wrapper
  proceeds.
- **`bin/sotp adr-baseline check-commit` exit 0** — required through `cargo make ci-track`;
  every recorded ADR must match its latest baseline and every cited, non-draft ADR must be
  stamped.

## Sequence

**Step 0: Fill missing commit message (when omitted)**

If no commit message is supplied:

1. Resolve the current track from the current git branch (`track/<id>`). If not on a track
   branch, fall back to the latest active track by `updated_at` for proposal-only mode.
2. Read `spec.md`, `plan.md`, `observations.md` (optional), and current changed files for context.
3. Propose 2-3 commit message candidates following the repository's current commit style and
   reflecting the actual change scope.
4. Stop after presenting candidates. Do not execute the guarded commit until the user selects
   a message.

**Step 1: Pre-commit checks**

1. Run `git diff --cached --stat` and verify the staged scope matches the intended commit.
2. If the staged diff is empty or includes unrelated changes, stop and fix staging before
   continuing. If `review.json` appears modified-but-unstaged, re-stage now before proceeding.
3. Confirm the current branch matches `track/<id>`. A guarded commit from a non-track branch
   is rejected fail-closed — switch to the track branch first.
4. `track/registry.md` is a generated view (gitignored, not version-controlled). Do NOT stage
   or commit it. If `plan.md` or `spec.md` views appear stale, run `bin/sotp track views sync`
   to regenerate them before staging.

**Step 2: Guarded commit**

Write the commit message to `tmp/track-commit/commit-message.txt`. Then run:

`cargo make track-commit-message` is a long-running gate. Run it as one blocking call and, when
it completes, read its terminal result once. If the host backgrounds the call, read the result
once after the single completion notification. Do not poll its logs, re-run status probes, or add
periodic re-checks. The commit gate runs `bin/sotp test-obligation check`; do not launch
`bin/sotp test-obligation evaluate` as a commit prerequisite. `evaluate` is only a synchronous
step inside repair work on the orchestrator host.

```
cargo make track-commit-message
```

This wrapper executes `cargo make ci`, `cargo make ci-track` (including
`bin/sotp adr-baseline check-commit`), review/ref-verify approval checks,
`bin/sotp test-obligation check`, and `bin/sotp dry check-approved`, then commits
from `tmp/track-commit/commit-message.txt`. It deletes the scratch file on success.
If the commit fails (CI failure or git error), report the error and stop. Do not proceed to
note generation. A byte mismatch from `adr-baseline check-commit` or its CI path is recovered
through the ADR-baseline route in `.harness/workflows/track/diagnose.md`, not by retrying the
guarded commit unchanged.

**Step 3: Attach git note**

After a successful commit, generate and attach a structured git note to HEAD.

*Step 3a — Generate note (normal path)*:

1. Find the current track under `track/items/`.
2. Read `spec.md` and `plan.md`; also read `observations.md` if it exists.
3. Run `git show HEAD --stat` to get the changed file list.
4. Generate the note text using the format below and write it to `tmp/track-commit/note.md`.
5. Run `bin/sotp git note-from-file tmp/track-commit/note.md --cleanup`.

*Step 3b — Skip note*: if no track directory exists and no generated scratch note is available,
skip note generation and mention this in the summary.

**Note format:**

```markdown
## Task Summary: <brief description>

**Track:** <track-id or "no-track">
**Task:** <task description from impl-plan.json done task, or commit subject>
**Date:** <YYYY-MM-DD>

### Changes

- <filename>: <what changed — one line per key file>

### Why

<1–3 sentences from spec.md/plan.md or commit context>
```

## Gates

| Step | Gate | Verdict |
|------|------|---------|
| 1 | Staged diff non-empty and matches intent | OK / fix-staging |
| 1 | Current branch matches `track/<id>` | OK / ERROR |
| 2 | `cargo make track-commit-message` exits 0 (CI + ADR-baseline-aware track gates + commit) | OK / ERROR |

## Failure / recovery

- **No commit message supplied**: generate proposals and stop. Do not execute commit.
- **Empty or wrong staged diff**: fix staging with `bin/sotp git add-all` or selective
  `bin/sotp git add-from-file tmp/track-commit/add-paths.txt --cleanup`, then re-run the workflow.
- **Non-track branch**: switch to the track branch and re-run.
- **`cargo make track-commit-message` failure**:
  - CI/gate failure (fmt, clippy, test, deny, layers, verify-*, ADR-baseline-aware track gates,
    test-obligation, DRY): fix the failing gate and re-run.
    Do not re-stage — the working tree is the same. Do not proceed to note generation.
  - ADR-baseline byte mismatch from `check-commit` or CI: stop the commit flow and enter the
    ADR-baseline recovery route in `diagnose.md`. The orchestrator dispatches `adr-diagnoser`;
    only `non-semantic-restamp` permits `snapshot --kind non-semantic-fix` and a retry.
    `deviation` restores the latest baseline and injects an amendment-proposal request into the
    originating capability briefing; `unknown-editor` restores and records the history in
    `observations.md`.
  - git commit error: diagnose (index state, branch protection) and resolve before retrying.
- **Note generation failure** (`bin/sotp git note-from-file` non-zero): report the error. The commit
  itself already succeeded; note failure is non-fatal but should be investigated.

## Outputs

- Commit on the current `track/<id>` branch (commit hash reported)
- Commit message used (echoed in summary)
- Git note attached to HEAD (or skipped with reason)
- `track/registry.md` status: regenerated locally via `bin/sotp track views sync` if stale,
  or already current (gitignored; not committed)
- Recommended next action reported to the caller
