## Mission

Run the autonomous feature-batch implement → DRY check → task completion → review → commit loop for the current
track. The default invocation mode (`normal`) consumes all remaining declared batches. The
consumption unit is the **declared batch**: the batches declared in
`track/items/<id>/batch-plan.json` `batches[]` are consumed in declaration order — each
batch's member tasks are implemented in dependency order into the same working tree without
intermediate commits, then a single DFP + review pass + commit close the batch. A caller may
request `--single-batch`; that invocation drains the first unfinished declared batch, including
any runtime admission-split execution units, then returns after Step 3 so its caller can refresh
and resume from durable state. It does not run the lifecycle tail, even when that was the last
batch. This workflow performs no batch composition of its own:
sizing, ceilings, and admission are planning- and admission-domain concerns, not execution
concerns. Requires being on a `track/<id>` branch.

Sub-workflows used:

- `.harness/workflows/track/implement.md`
- `.harness/workflows/track/dry-check.md`
- `.harness/workflows/track/review.md`
- `.harness/workflows/track/commit.md`

## Inputs

- **Current branch** — must match `track/<id>`. If not, stop and suggest switching.
- **`impl-plan.json`** — task list with status and declared dependencies.
- **`batch-plan.json`** — the declared ordered `batches[]` (read-only here; impl-planner is its
  sole writer). Absence on the active track is an error (fail-closed) — admission refuses every
  transition into work without it, so there is no declaration-less execution lane. A track
  planned before this artifact existed re-enters by declaring its REMAINING work only (the
  unsettled-task declaration domain): the impl-planner issues a batch-plan covering the open
  tasks, and settled history stays undeclared per the non-retroactivity constraint.
- **`spec.md`, `plan.md`, `metadata.json`** — task context for the implement sub-workflow.
- **Invocation mode** — `normal` is the default when `--single-batch` is absent. A caller may
  pass `--single-batch` to drain the first unfinished batch selected by Step 0a, including any
  execution units created by runtime admission splits, and return after that declared batch's
  Step 3. The option does not change the declared batch plan or run the lifecycle tail.

## Sequence

### Step 0: Build an execution plan (required before any execution)

Resolve the invocation mode, using `normal` when `--single-batch` is absent. Use the track CLI
summaries, declared batch state, and selected task briefing as the primary intake. Do not bulk-read
every referenced sub-workflow definition before execution. Treat each referenced workflow as its
own SSoT and open its body only for the active handoff or a targeted
diff/blocker investigation. Follow the referenced workflow's own contract; where it delegates
work, its delegated capability owns that detailed procedure.

**Step 0a: Load the declared batches**

Read `track/items/<id>/batch-plan.json` and take `batches[]` as the execution sequence,
in declaration order. This workflow composes no batches and re-runs no Phase 3
structural check: the declared composition already passed `bin/sotp batch-plan check`.
Per-transition admission — the machine judgment on every entry into work — still fires
at Step 1 and may reject a member at runtime; the workflow's only response is the unit
split described there. It never re-composes or merges batches.

When `batch-plan.json` is absent: this is an error on every active track — stop and
route to Phase 3 (impl-planner) instead of composing batches here. A track planned
before the artifact existed re-enters the same way, declaring its remaining unsettled
work only (settled history stays undeclared per the non-retroactivity constraint).

Select the current batch: the first batch in declaration order that still has a member task
not yet `done`-with-`commit_hash` (skip `skipped` members). Within it, carry a `done` member
with null `commit_hash` forward as **DonePending** (implementation complete, but still
participates in DFP, Review, Commit, and post-commit task hash backfill).

**Step 0b: Order tasks inside the batch by implementation dependencies**

Within the batch, run `implement` in dependency order for `todo` / `in_progress` tasks only,
honouring the `depends_on` edges declared in `impl-plan.json` (lower-layer first where no
edge dictates otherwise). DonePending tasks keep their position for downstream gates.

### Re-entry after PR correction or residual-work recovery

When the `pr-review` workflow has completed a writer-owned correction's partial-reentry /
post-routing descent, or has verified a matching open PR and registered genuine residual work
through `bin/sotp track add-task`, the caller returns here only after the required Phase 3 re-plan
and on-branch obligation derivation for that correction have converged. Rebuild the task summaries
from durable task data with `bin/sotp track resolve`, `bin/sotp track task-counts`, and
`bin/sotp track next-task`, then rebuild the execution plan from the durable `impl-plan.json`,
`batch-plan.json`, and those summaries; do not reuse an earlier in-memory batch selection. This
check includes unfinished tasks already represented before the correction, not only newly
registered residual tasks. The first unfinished declared batch is the re-entry point, while
existing `done` / `skipped` history and `DonePending` handling remain unchanged.

Use a normal full-cycle invocation (without `--single-batch`) for this re-entry. It must consume
all remaining batches and the lifecycle tail before the caller re-runs `pr-review`. This workflow
does not query GitHub or decide whether a PR is recoverable; the one remote-state check belongs to
the `pr-review` recovery branch. Ordinary pre-PR full-cycle, task authoring, and obligation
derivation therefore remain usable without PR state.

### Long-running gate waiting

Every long-running capability dispatch, workflow, or gate wrapper in this loop is one blocking
call whose terminal result is read once. If the host backgrounds a call, read the result once
after the single completion notification. Do not poll logs, re-run status probes, or add
fire-and-forget launches; any internal CLI or workflow loop remains owned by the called unit.
`bin/sotp test-obligation evaluate` is only a synchronous repair step on the orchestrator host,
never a background launch or a commit-gate prerequisite; the commit gate runs `check`.

### Execution (per batch)

**Step 1: Implement (batch-scoped)**

Invoke the `implement` workflow (`.harness/workflows/track/implement.md`) over every `todo`
task in this batch in Step 0b order. Each task enters implementation through its
`todo → in_progress` transition; if the transition's admission judgment **rejects** a later
member (e.g. the ceiling would be exceeded by its estimate on top of the prior contribution),
apply the runtime split: close the current execution unit at that task boundary — the
already-admitted prefix proceeds through DFP → Review → Commit as this unit — and the
rejected member starts the next execution unit (which re-attempts its transition against the
post-commit baseline). Runtime may only split a declared batch this way, never merge batches.
From the split onward, every later per-batch step (Step 1d done-marking, Step 3 commit and
hash backfill) operates on the **admitted execution unit's task set**, not the full declared
batch; the rejected member stays `todo` and is untouched until its own unit.

For an `in_progress` task, first check whether its
working-tree implementation already exists (a prior standalone `/track:implement` hands tasks
off `in_progress` without transitioning them): if the task's implementation is already present
and CI passes, skip re-implementation and carry it forward like a DonePending task; only
(re-)implement an `in_progress` task whose work is absent or incomplete. For DonePending tasks,
skip implementation only — keep the task in the batch so its working-tree changes flow through
DFP, Review, Commit, and post-commit task hash recording. Do NOT commit between tasks in the
same batch.

Test-obligation handoff: a catalogue-bearing track enters this loop already enrolled
(`obligations.json` + `test-bindings.json` from the `type-design` workflow's terminal derive
step). The `implement` workflow's Step 4 authors binding increments
against those obligations per batch; this workflow adds no enrollment decision of its own,
and the commit gate's `sotp test-obligation check` fail-closes if the artifacts are missing.

No actual-diff measurement happens in this workflow: the ceiling concept exists only in the
planning and admission domains. Once implementation has started, diff growth — including
growth from review fixes and DRY fixes — is never measured against or treated as exceeding a
ceiling; actual measurement is read only as an admission baseline, never here.

**Step 1c: DRY fix phase (DFP, once per batch)**

Invoke the `dry-check` workflow (`.harness/workflows/track/dry-check.md`) once for the
accumulated batch diff. DFP runs **before** Review (RFP) and is loosely coupled to it.

Branch on the dfl terminal state (four mutually-exclusive outcomes):

- **`skipped`**: treat as equivalent to `completed`; proceed to Review (Step 2).
- **`completed`**: DRY gate Approved; proceed to Review (Step 2).
- **`blocked`**: halt the batch loop immediately. Surface unresolved DRY violation pairs
  (`bin/sotp dry results --track-id <id> --filter violation`). Do NOT proceed to Review or
  Commit. Escalate for manual resolution.
- **`failed`**: stop the loop and report the error. Do NOT proceed.

**Post-DFP R2 repeat.** On the `completed` path, dfl edited the working tree after the
`implement` workflow's Step 5 verification ran, so before proceeding to Review repeat the
pre-review verification required by
`.harness/policies/implementation-delegation.md#R2. review 起動前に配置を検証する`. That policy
owns the verification's steps; this workflow owns repeating it at every boundary where source is
mutated between that verification and Review. The `skipped` path launches no dfl and mutates
nothing, so the Step 5 verification still holds and no repeat is required there.

**Step 1d: Orchestrator marks completed tasks done**

After CI passes and DFP reaches `skipped` or `completed`, the orchestrator marks each successfully
implemented `todo` / `in_progress` task in the batch `done` before Review. DonePending tasks are
already `done` and require no state transition at this point. The orchestrator does not record a
commit hash yet; it backfills that hash only after the batch commit in Step 3.

**Step 2: Review (single round per batch)**

Invoke the `review` workflow (`.harness/workflows/track/review.md`) once. Required scopes come
from `bin/sotp review results`, which auto-classifies the accumulated batch diff. Review must
reach full-model `zero_findings` in every required scope.

**Back-edge (RFP → DFP fixpoint)**: review fixes can reintroduce duplication. After Review
reaches `zero_findings`, re-run Step 1c (DFP) before returning to Review or Commit. On this
back-edge the review fixers themselves mutated source, so the Step 1c R2 repeat applies
unconditionally — perform it before returning to Review, whatever the back-edge DFP's terminal
state. Iterate until the DRY gate stays Approved and review stays `zero_findings` with no new
edits. Diff growth introduced by review fixes or DRY fixes is never treated as a ceiling
overrun (the ceiling concept does not exist in this domain).

**Step 3: Commit (single commit per batch)**

Stage **after** the final review round (`bin/sotp git add-all` or selective
`bin/sotp git add-from-file tmp/track-commit/add-paths.txt --cleanup`),
then invoke the `commit` workflow (`.harness/workflows/track/commit.md`) once with a commit
message naming the batch (e.g., "Batch A: T002-T004 …").

The `commit` workflow enforces the track-aware gates as hard preconditions via
`cargo make track-commit-message` (including `cargo make ci-track`,
`sotp test-obligation check`, and `sotp dry check-approved` before committing).
A `blocked` DFP or failing test-obligation gate cannot be committed past.

**Orchestrator post-commit task hash recording**: after the commit succeeds, the orchestrator
backfills the single commit hash on every task in this execution unit — the admitted task set
when a runtime split occurred, otherwise the declared batch — including DonePending tasks, with:

```
bin/sotp track transition <task_id> done --commit-hash <hash>
```

`TaskStatus::Done` has no `commit_hash` uniqueness constraint; the same hash on multiple
tasks is the canonical representation of a batch commit.

**Step 3a: Continue or return**

After Step 3, re-evaluate the declared batch state using Step 0a. Without `--single-batch`, if
an unfinished batch remains, repeat Steps 0a–3 so the next execution starts at the first
unfinished batch. With `--single-batch`, if the selected declared batch remains unfinished
because a runtime admission split left a rejected member in `todo`, repeat Steps 0a–3 in this
same invocation to consume its next admitted execution unit; do not return between execution
units. Once the selected declared batch is complete, return to the caller before Step 4 or
Post-loop, even when no later declared batch remains. The caller refreshes and a subsequent
normal invocation runs Step 4 when no unfinished declared batch remains.

For a PR correction or residual-work re-entry, the caller must use the normal-mode path above and
wait for this workflow's terminal result, including the lifecycle tail, before triggering another
PR review. Returning after a single batch or re-reviewing while an unfinished task remains is not
a complete recovery.

### Step 4: Lifecycle tail commit (after all batches)

Run this section only after Step 3a finds no unfinished declared batch. A `--single-batch`
invocation always returns before this section after its selected declared batch completes; a
subsequent normal invocation runs it for the last batch.

Post-commit task hash recording (Step 3) writes the commit hash to `impl-plan.json` *after*
the batch commit — the hash cannot exist before the commit. For the last batch, no successor
batch captures these writes.

Procedure (after Step 3 of the **last** batch):

1. Inspect the working tree with `git status --short`. Expect modifications limited to
   `track/items/<track-id>/impl-plan.json` and `track/items/<track-id>/plan.md` only.
2. If those (and only those) files are modified, run a tail review refresh before committing:
   - Invoke the `review` workflow. Expected required scope: `impl-plan` (the tail diff is
     only the task hash backfill in `impl-plan.json`; the rendered `plan.md` is
     review-operational and does not affect scope hashes).
   - Continue only after `bin/sotp review check-approved` succeeds and:
     `bin/sotp review results --track-id <track-id> --scope impl-plan --round-type final --limit 1`
     shows a recorded final `zero_findings` round for the tail diff.
   - This review refresh is mandatory: `cargo make track-commit-message` runs
     `bin/sotp review check-approved` before committing, and after Step 3 mutates
     `impl-plan.json` / `plan.md`, the previous `impl-plan` review hash is stale.
3. After the tail review refresh succeeds, stage and commit the lifecycle diff:
   1. Run `bin/sotp git add-all` to stage the task hash backfill (plus any review-operational artifacts produced by Step 2's review refresh, e.g. `review.json` / `<layer>-type-signals.json`).
   2. Write the lifecycle tail commit message to `tmp/track-commit/commit-message.txt`. The wrapper in the next step reads this exact path (`bin/sotp git commit-from-file tmp/track-commit/commit-message.txt --cleanup`), so the file must exist before invoking it. A typical message is:

      ```
      ops(track): backfill task commit hashes for batch <name>
      ```
   3. Run `cargo make track-commit-message`. The wrapper runs CI + `cargo make ci-track` + `bin/sotp review check-approved` + the test-obligation gate + the DRY-gate precondition, then commits from the file and deletes it on success.
   4. (Optional, recommended) Attach a git note via `bin/sotp git note-from-file tmp/track-commit/note.md --cleanup`.
4. If no `impl-plan.json` / `plan.md` modifications were present in Step 1, skip this step.
5. After Step 2, dirty files may include the two plan artifacts plus review-operational
   artifacts produced by the refresh and staged by Step 3. If `git status --short` shows any
   other files before the commit, stop and report. After `cargo make track-commit-message`
   succeeds, `git status --short` must be empty; any remaining dirty file is unexpected and
   must be investigated before declaring the loop complete.

The workflow completes only when `git status --short` is empty after this step.

### Post-loop

After all batches are committed and the optional lifecycle tail commit is recorded, the terminal
invocation creates or appends to `track/items/<id>/observations.md` only when:

- (a) Any task produced machine-non-verifiable observations worth recording, or
- (b) `spec.json`'s `acceptance_criteria` explicitly mandates recording to `observations.md`.

Otherwise, skip (file absence = no observations).

## Gates

| Step | Gate | Verdict |
|------|------|---------|
| 1 | Track branch and active tasks found | OK / stop |
| 1c | DFP terminal state | skipped/completed → Step 1d; blocked/failed → halt |
| 1c | R2 placement verification repeated after a `completed` DFP | pass / fail |
| 1d | Successful batch tasks marked `done` before review | OK / stop |
| 2 | Review `zero_findings` all required scopes | completed / blocked / failed |
| 2 | R2 placement verification repeated on each back-edge pass | pass / fail |
| 3 | `cargo make track-commit-message` (CI + track-aware gates + DRY check) | OK / ERROR |
| 3a | Default mode continues; `--single-batch` drains one declared batch and returns before Step 4 | OK / stop |
| 4 | `git status --short` empty | OK / unexpected dirty state |

## Failure / recovery

- **Wrong branch**: stop and suggest switching to `track/<id>`.
- **DFP `blocked`**: halt the loop. Surface violation pairs. Do not proceed to review.
- **DFP `failed`**: stop and report tooling error.
- **Review `blocked_cross_scope`**: fix cross-scope dependencies, then relaunch the affected scope.
- **Review `failed` / timeout**: relaunch (up to 2 retries per fixer), then report.
- **Commit failure**: fix CI or staging issue. Do not re-stage until the issue is resolved.
- **PR correction/residual-work re-entry**: reconstruct the first unfinished batch from durable
  task and batch state and run normal full-cycle to completion. Do not query PR state here; return
  to `pr-review` only after every remaining batch and the lifecycle tail succeed.
- **Unexpected dirty state in Step 4**: stop and investigate before declaring completion.

## Outputs

- Commits on the current `track/<id>` branch, one per batch + optional lifecycle tail
- Commit hashes recorded by the orchestrator on all batch tasks via
  `bin/sotp track transition done --commit-hash`
- Optional `track/items/<id>/observations.md`
- Summary: batches executed (task IDs, commit hash per batch), tasks completed, tasks remaining,
  any failures, recommended next command (`pr-review` workflow)
