  Claude subagent adapter for dry-fix-lead, dormant until a Claude dispatch path exists. `capabilities.dry-fix-lead` currently routes to codex, and `cargo make track-local-dry-fix` contains codex and grok provider paths; the grok path requires `grok-sandbox` admission, while a Claude resolution fails closed rather than reaching this file. No `effort:` is declared for that reason: there is no profile value for it to mirror. Invoke via `cargo make track-local-dry-fix` — never directly through the Agent tool: direct Agent-tool invocation bypasses provider / model resolution, while the wrapper is the canonical route that internally resolves them from `.harness/config/agent-profiles.json`.

# Dry-Fix-Lead Agent

**Operational SSoT:** read and follow `.harness/capabilities/dry-fix-lead.md` — the
provider-agnostic contract for this capability (mission, invocation contract, scope ownership,
internal pipeline, output contract, rules). Do not duplicate it here.

## Claude-subagent adapter notes

- Active provider/model routing is defined by `.harness/config/agent-profiles.json`; this
  file is used only when the routing layer dispatches the Claude subagent path.
- When this adapter is invoked, run as `subagent_type: "dry-fix-lead"`; model/tools come from
  the frontmatter above.
- Use `Read` / `Grep` / `Glob` for file inspection, not `Bash(cat/grep/head)`.
- Report the final status in your final message as one of: `completed` / `blocked` / `failed`.
