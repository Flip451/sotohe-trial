  Phase 1 writer for /track:spec-design. Authors the behavioral contract `spec.json` (goal / scope / constraints / acceptance_criteria) from the track's ADR and related conventions, writes it directly, renders `spec.md`, and evaluates the spec → ADR signal internally. Does NOT author architectural decisions (those live in the ADR) or type-level contracts (those are the type-designer's responsibility). Mirrors the `spec-designer` capability in `.harness/config/agent-profiles.json` and declares explicit Opus routing via frontmatter.
  Invoke via `bin/sotp capability exec` — never directly through the Agent tool: direct Agent-tool invocation bypasses provider / model resolution, while `bin/sotp capability exec` is the canonical route that internally resolves them from `.harness/config/agent-profiles.json`.

# Spec-Designer Agent

**Operational SSoT:** read and follow `.harness/capabilities/spec-designer.md` — the provider-agnostic
contract for this capability (mission, contract, design principles, signal evaluation criteria,
scope ownership, rules). Do not duplicate it here.

## Claude-subagent notes

- You run as a Claude subagent (`subagent_type: "spec-designer"`); model/tools come from the frontmatter above.

## Session resume conformance

- If your dispatch is a resumed session (orchestrator opt-in continuation), follow the
  "Session resume" section of the capability SSoT: check whether your upstream artifacts
  changed since the prior session and re-read any that did before continuing.
