# Orchestration

This conditionally loaded document is the detailed Claude-side orchestration reference. The
concise always-applied root rule surface is `.claude/rules/orchestrator.md`; this file is read
when workflow control or capability routing is in scope, and is not a PR-review briefing.

The root orchestrator is selected by `.harness/config/agent-profiles.json` at
`capabilities.orchestrator.provider`. Claude Code and Codex CLI are both permanent template
choices. This file describes the Claude-side operating rules while preserving the same `/track:*`
workflow for either root host.

- User-facing interface: `/track:*`
- Context management: `track/`
- Capability routing: `.harness/config/agent-profiles.json`
- Provider authority: each capability resolves through `capabilities.<name>.provider`; the
  config file is the source of truth for every capability, and no provider is assumed from the
  host session — dispatch through `bin/sotp capability exec` and let it resolve.
- Parallel execution: Agent Teams

Host orchestration may run in Claude Code or Codex depending on `capabilities.orchestrator.provider`.
Specialist capabilities may switch as models evolve, but the public `/track:*` interface should remain stable.
Codex root orchestration uses tracked `.codex` config, rules, hooks, agents, and repo-scoped
`.agents/skills`; those project-local surfaces require a trusted checkout before they can be treated
as active guardrails.

Terms:

- `track`: `metadata.json` (identity SSoT) / `spec.json` (Phase 1 behavioral contract SSoT) / `<layer>-types.json` (Phase 2 type-contract SSoT) / `impl-plan.json` + `task-coverage.json` + `task-contract.json` + `batch-plan.json` (Phase 3 implementation plan SSoT) / `spec.md` / `plan.md` (read-only rendered views) / `observations.md` (optional manual observation log) / progress management layer

## Summary-first context intake

Before planning or implementation, collect the summaries needed for the current workflow:

- `bin/sotp track resolve`, `bin/sotp track task-counts`, and `bin/sotp track next-task` for phase
  and progress;
- `bin/sotp review results` for scopes that need review;
- `bin/sotp test-obligation results` for enrollment and fulfillment state when the track is enrolled;
  and
- `bin/sotp catalog check` plus `bin/sotp ref-verify results --chain 2 --filter all` for catalogue
  completion and catalogue-to-specification state.

Treat CLI output and the delegated task briefing as primary. Do not bulk-read track artifacts,
review or binding JSON, full workflow texts, or convention lists during intake. Open an artifact
body only for a targeted diff or a blocker investigation. The dispatcher supplies resolved
convention paths in each capability briefing; the delegated capability reads those paths, while
the orchestrator does not enumerate or read conventions itself. The typed-pipeline local
reviewer and review-fix-lead routes are a bounded exception: the review workflow itself resolves
the applicable paths from the track's convention references and the consumer-owned
`knowledge/conventions/README.md` `Current Files` index while preparing their briefings.

The `adr2pr` workflow's mandatory Step 0 is a bounded exception: before executing that workflow,
read each sub-workflow definition it enumerates to build the required execution plan. This is
required workflow planning, not general bulk intake.

The track artifacts, ADR index, policies, architecture rules, and provider-specific rules remain
the applicable sources of truth. Read only the specific path required by the current workflow
step or blocker, after the summary intake, and keep the provider-neutral workflow SSoT under
`.harness/workflows/track/` authoritative for shared behavior.

Operational split:

- `README.md`: user-facing entry point (value proposition / prerequisites / getting started / free-form request examples)
- `CLAUDE.md`: maintainer/reference guide
- `knowledge/conventions/`: project-specific engineering rules, day-to-day workflow rules, and implementation policies
- `architecture-rules.json`: machine-readable layer dependency source of truth for `deny.toml` and `sotp verify layers`
- `.harness/config/agent-profiles.json`: capability-to-provider mapping source of truth

## Planning Gate (Mandatory)

Complete Phase 0–3 planning before implementation, regardless of task difficulty: `/track:plan` orchestrates init → spec → design → impl-plan and back-and-forth escalation when downstream signals fail, and end-to-end workflows such as `/track:adr2pr` own the equivalent sequencing on an initialized track (do not invoke `/track:plan` on a `track/<id>` branch it already initialized). Skipping design entirely causes expensive downstream review loops (historical lesson: 15+ review rounds from skipped design).

## Delegation Rules

Use the minimum capable capability first, then dispatch it through the CLI or wrapper that
resolves its profile internally.

### Capability session resume (caller-side decision)

The continuation/fresh decision belongs to the dispatching orchestrator, BEFORE dispatch.
Session reuse applies only when the dispatcher invokes a provider subprocess:

- Pass `--resume` to `bin/sotp capability exec` when the dispatch continues the SAME
  assignment for the same track and capability (a follow-up round on the same briefing, a
  retry after an incomplete round, resuming interrupted work). Outside a track add
  `--target-artifact <repo-relative-path>` for each target; a track-external dispatch with
  no determined target must stay fresh.
- A Claude-root dispatch that also resolves to the Claude provider returns a
  `delegate-in-host` instruction before the session cache is consulted. Its native Claude Agent
  invocation always starts fresh; do not pass `--resume` expecting it to reuse a session.
- Do NOT pass `--resume` on a first dispatch or when the assignment's concern changes
  (new task, new briefing subject) — those run as new sessions.
- Resume never needs manual cache management: provider/model mismatch, resume failure, or
  expiry falls back to a fresh session without aborting the dispatch, and all execution
  flags are explicitly re-specified either way. Reviewer rounds resume automatically inside
  `bin/sotp review local`; no caller flag exists there.

- Claude Code or Codex (`orchestrator` host):
  - normal edits
  - workflow control
  - file synchronization
  - user interaction
- specialist capabilities:
  - `orchestrator`: overall coordination (Claude Code or Codex, resolved from `capabilities.orchestrator.provider`)
  - `spec-designer`: behavioral contract authoring (Phase 1 spec.json writer)
  - `type-designer`: type-level contract authoring (Phase 2 `<layer>-types.json` writer, TDDD workflow)
  - `impl-planner`: implementation plan authoring (Phase 3 impl-plan.json + task-coverage.json + task-contract.json + batch-plan.json writer)
  - `adr-editor`: ADR back-and-forth modification (invoked by `/track:plan` when spec → ADR signal turns 🔴)
  - `implementer`: difficult Rust implementation, refactoring, performance-oriented edits
  - `reviewer`: code review, correctness analysis, idiomatic Rust checks
  - `researcher`: crate research, codebase-wide analysis, external research
- provider-routing SSoT (`.harness/config/agent-profiles.json`; resolved internally by the
  relevant CLI or dispatcher):
  - `orchestrator` → `capabilities.orchestrator.provider`
  - `spec-designer` / `type-designer` / `impl-planner` / `adr-editor` / `implementer` → their own capability provider entries
  - `reviewer` / `review-fix-lead` / `dry-checker` / `dry-fix-lead` → their own capability provider entries
  - `researcher` → its own capability provider entry
- Agent Teams:
  - `/track:implement`
  - `/track:review`

If unsure:

1. Workflow control or user interaction -> active root orchestrator
2. Research need -> `researcher`
3. Behavioral spec authoring -> `spec-designer`
4. Type catalogue authoring -> `type-designer`
5. Implementation plan authoring -> `impl-planner`
6. ADR back-and-forth modification -> `adr-editor`
7. Review need -> `reviewer`
8. Implementation work -> `implementer`

If stuck for 3+ iterations, use `researcher` to diagnose the root cause before escalating.
