# Development Environment (Rust)

This conditionally loaded rule applies when running repository tooling; the concise root
orchestrator rules are in `.claude/rules/orchestrator.md`.

## Toolchain

An exported scaffold is host-first. `rust-toolchain.toml` selects the required Rust toolchain
(including rustfmt and clippy); install `cargo-make` before running its tasks. Docker is optional
there: change the single `extend` target in `Makefile.toml` from `Makefile.host.toml` to
`Makefile.docker.toml` when an isolated toolchain is needed. The SoTOHE-core source repository
uses Docker Compose for `cargo make bootstrap` and its default quality gates.

```bash
rustup show
cargo install --locked cargo-make --version 0.37.24
cargo make init # newly exported scaffold: create the repository and run bootstrap once
```

For an already initialized repository (including the source repository), use `cargo make bootstrap`.
Its behavior is determined by the repository kind. In an exported scaffold, it installs the pinned `cargo-nextest` and
`cargo-deny` tools with `--locked`, installs `bin/sotp` when a transplanted binary is unavailable,
configures local hooks, and runs the host-first repository gate. In the SoTOHE-core source
repository, it requires Docker and Docker Compose, builds `bin/sotp` from the working tree,
configures the runtime and local hooks, and runs the Docker-backed repository gate; it does not
perform the exported scaffold's auxiliary-tool installation or fallback `install-sotp` step.
Neither variant adds a separate tool-version preflight.

## Task Runner: cargo-make

`Makefile.toml` owns the current task table. Use `cargo make --list-all-steps` for discovery.
`init` is a one-time command for a newly exported scaffold; the remaining workflow-stable
commands below work in both the source repository and an exported scaffold.

```bash
cargo make init         # newly exported scaffold: run once before other workflow tasks
cargo make bootstrap    # environment-specific bootstrap; see the distinction above
cargo make fmt-check    # verify formatting
cargo make clippy       # lint with warnings denied
cargo make test         # run cargo-nextest
cargo make deny         # run cargo-deny
cargo make ci-rust      # Rust-only inner-loop gate
cargo make ci           # repository-wide gate
cargo make ci-track     # track-aware gate on track/<id>
cargo make --list-all-steps # task catalogue

bin/sotp arch tree
bin/sotp arch tree-full
```

## Workflow commands

Use `bin/sotp` for single workflow operations; use `cargo make` only for aggregate gates.
This keeps the documentation valid when the source repository and exported scaffold select
different Makefile execution environments.

Commits are the exception: write the message to `tmp/track-commit/commit-message.txt` and run
the guarded `cargo make track-commit-message` (CI + track-aware gates + review/ref-verify +
DRY gate before the commit). Never call the commit subcommand it wraps directly.

```bash
bin/sotp git add-from-file tmp/track-commit/add-paths.txt
bin/sotp git unstage <paths>
bin/sotp git note-from-file tmp/track-commit/note.md --cleanup
bin/sotp git sync
bin/sotp track branch create <track-id>
bin/sotp track branch switch <track-id>
bin/sotp track switch-base
bin/sotp pr push
bin/sotp pr ensure-pr
bin/sotp pr review-cycle
bin/sotp track transition T001 done
bin/sotp track views sync
bin/sotp track resolve
bin/sotp capability exec <capability> --host <provider> --briefing-file tmp/capability-runtime/briefing.md
```

## `bin/sotp` provisioning

`bin/sotp` is gitignored. In an exported scaffold, template export transplants the running
binary when possible; otherwise `cargo make install-sotp` retrieves the pinned tag declared
in `.harness/config/sotp-version.json`. The exported scaffold's CI follows the latter path
and caches `.cargo-install` under a key containing that tag. In the SoTOHE-core source
repository itself, build the binary from the working tree with `cargo make build-sotp`
(rebuild it after changing sotp source code).

## Project Bootstrap (Version Research)

Research new version baselines before changing pinned tool versions. Record the result under
`knowledge/research/` and update the corresponding toolchain, bootstrap, and CI pins together.

## Testing and dependency auditing

```bash
cargo make test
cargo make deny
```

Run `cargo make ci` before handing off a change.
