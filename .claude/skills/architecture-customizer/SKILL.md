name: architecture-customizer
description: Customize or migrate the Rust workspace architecture (layer names, crate boundaries, dependency direction) safely. Use when users want to change layered architecture structure, rename/move crates, switch architecture style, or update enforcement rules across architecture-rules.json, Cargo.toml, deny.toml, Makefile tasks, and track docs.

# /architecture-customizer — Workspace Architecture Migration Workflow

Use this workflow when architecture changes are requested.

## Workflow

1. Clarify target architecture in the user's preferred or project language with a concrete crate map.
2. Translate target architecture into explicit dependency rules and deny reasons.
3. Update enforcement first, then code layout, then docs.
4. Run architecture checks and stop if any gate fails.

## Step 1: Define Target Crate Map

Write the target map before any edits using workspace member paths:

```text
<root-a>/<crate-a>
<root-a>/<crate-b>
<root-b>/<crate-c>
...
```

Default template examples often use `apps/<entry>` and `libs/<layer>`, but other roots are allowed if `architecture-rules.json`, enforcement, and docs are updated together.

Define which crates may depend on which crates.

## Step 2: Update Enforcement Rules

1. Update workspace members in `Cargo.toml`.
2. Update `architecture-rules.json` first (this is the SSoT consumed by `bin/sotp verify layers`).
3. Update layer policy in `deny.toml` (`deny = [...]` wrappers).
4. Update `Makefile.toml` task names if any crates were renamed.
5. Update the layer ids in `.harness/catalogue-lint/config.json` and
   `.harness/catalogue-lint/presets/ddd-strict.json` together. Every role carries a
   `KindLayerConstraint` whose `permitted_layers` matches layer ids literally, so a rename
   leaves every role permitting only the old ids and `bin/sotp catalogue-lint
   check-active-track` rejects valid entries across the whole matrix. The two files must stay
   structurally equal.

## Step 3: Update Crates

1. Create/move/rename crate directories.
2. Update each crate `Cargo.toml` dependency edges.
3. Ensure composition root crate wires dependencies.

## Step 4: Update Documentation

1. Record the architecture decision in a pre-track ADR under `knowledge/adr/`.
2. Update `Makefile.toml` `ci-local` / `ci-container` dependencies if quality gates change, and ensure `sotp verify layers` still reflects the new architecture rules.
3. Update `knowledge/conventions/coding-principles.md` module layout example if module conventions change.
4. Synchronize the live architecture-document set: `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`,
   this skill,
   `.harness/capabilities/{implementer,dry-fix-lead,review-fix-lead,rollback-diagnoser}.md`,
   `.harness/custom/review-prompts/{cli,cli_composition,cli_driver,domain,infrastructure,types,usecase}.md`,
   and applicable `knowledge/conventions/` references (especially
   `coding-principles.md` and `type-designer-kind-selection.md`).

## Step 5: Validation Gates

Run in this order:

```bash
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo make check-layers       # internally calls bin/sotp verify layers against architecture-rules.json
cargo make verify-arch-docs
cargo deny check -D warnings
cargo make ci                 # runs the shipped catalogue-lint configuration regression tests
```

If any command fails, fix architecture rules before implementation work.

## Output Contract

Report with:

1. New crate map
2. Enforced dependency rules
3. Files changed
4. Validation results
