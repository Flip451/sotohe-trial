## Invocation

User invokes this command as `/track:impl-plan`. No arguments.

## Claude Code invocation constraints

- **Context intake**: follow the impl-plan workflow SSoT's `Summary-first context intake`.
  Use CLI summaries as the primary context; do not bulk-read `*-types.json`, plan artifacts,
  review or binding JSON, full sub-workflow texts, or a `Related Conventions` list. Open only a
  targeted diff or the body named by a blocker; the dispatcher supplies exact spec, catalogue,
  ADR, and convention paths to the delegated capability.

Write a briefing containing the track id, paths to `spec.json` and each `<layer>-types.json`,
and paths to the related ADR(s). Do not put convention paths in the briefing: the capability
dispatcher resolves the `impl-planner` convention set and delivers it with the dispatch, and
that resolution is the complete convention input (workflow SSoT § Inputs). Then run
`bin/sotp phase enter impl-plan`. Phase entry runs its declared convergence checks and launches
the configured writer only after they pass. Do not launch the writer from this adapter.

The subagent owns: writing `impl-plan.json`, `task-coverage.json`, `task-contract.json`, and `batch-plan.json` (sole writer of all four), and evaluating both binary gates — task-coverage (`bin/sotp verify plan-artifact-refs`) and batch-plan structural (`bin/sotp batch-plan check`); Phase 3 passes only when both are OK.

## Report format

Report: track id, `impl-plan.json`, `task-coverage.json`, `task-contract.json`, and `batch-plan.json` paths, task count, both gate verdicts (OK / ERROR each).
