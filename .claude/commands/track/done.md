## Invocation

User invokes this command as `/track:done`. `$ARGUMENTS` is unused.

## Claude Code invocation constraints

- Bash command used:
  - `bin/sotp track switch-base` (switches to the configured base branch and performs the ff-only pull step)
- Read tool used to surface `track/registry.md` content for the completion summary.

## Report format

After execution, summarize:

1. Confirmation that the working tree is on the configured base branch, plus the wrapper's sync-result line verbatim (`[OK] On <base>, up to date.` = confirmed up to date with origin, or `[WARN] Pull failed ...` = sync attempted only; do not restate the WARN case as "up to date").
2. Latest completed track (name + date) from `track/registry.md`.
3. Count of remaining active tracks.
4. Recommended next command (`/track:implement`, `/track:full-cycle`, or `/track:plan <feature>`).
