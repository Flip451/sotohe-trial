## Invocation

User invokes this command as `/track:commit`. Use `$ARGUMENTS` as the commit message. If empty, inspect the current track and propose 2–3 commit message candidates, then stop.

## Claude Code invocation constraints

This command runs directly — no subagents. Key wrappers used:

- `git diff --cached --stat` (read-only — verify staged scope)
- `git show HEAD --stat` (read-only — changed files for git note)
- Write commit message to `tmp/track-commit/commit-message.txt` (Read + Edit preferred)
- `cargo make track-commit-message` — guarded commit (CI, ADR-baseline check, + commit)
- Write note to `tmp/track-commit/note.md`, then `bin/sotp git note-from-file tmp/track-commit/note.md --cleanup`

`track/registry.md` is gitignored — do NOT stage or commit it.

### Gate waiting

- `cargo make track-commit-message` is a long-running gate: run it as one blocking call and read
  its exit status once. Do not poll its log, re-run status probes, or add periodic re-checks; if
  the host backgrounds the call, read the result once after the single completion notification.
- Do not launch `bin/sotp test-obligation evaluate` around the commit: the commit gate runs
  `check`, and `evaluate` is only a synchronous step inside repair work on the orchestrator host.

## Report format

After execution, report:

1. Commit result (success/failure) and commit hash.
2. Commit message used.
3. `track/registry.md` status: regenerated locally / already current / skipped (gitignored).
4. Git note status: applied or skipped (reason).
5. Next recommended action.
