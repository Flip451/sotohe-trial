# Track-Spec-Design (Codex skill)

**Operational SSoT:** read and follow `.harness/workflows/track/spec-design.md` — the provider-agnostic
workflow contract for this skill. Do not duplicate step sequence, gate conditions, state transitions,
or failure-recovery procedures here.

## Codex-skill notes

### (1) Invocation surface

- Triggered via `$track-spec-design` in a Codex skill mention surface.
- Can also be force-loaded with `codex exec` by referencing this skill file.

### (2) Sandbox constraint

- Requires `--sandbox workspace-write`: the spec-designer capability writes `spec.json`
  and renders `spec.md` to the working tree.

### (3) Sub-workflow and capability invocation

Prepare the configured briefing and enter the phase through
`bin/sotp phase enter spec-design`. Do not launch the writer directly. The workflow SSoT owns
context intake, convergence, signal handling, gates, and recovery.

### (4) Reporting format

- On successful completion, print: `SPEC_DESIGN_STATUS: completed — spec.json written, signal blue`
- On gate failure or block, print: `SPEC_DESIGN_STATUS: blocked — <signal>: <reason>`
