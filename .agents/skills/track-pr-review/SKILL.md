# Track-Pr-Review (Codex skill)

**Operational SSoT:** read and follow `.harness/workflows/track/pr-review.md` — the provider-agnostic
workflow contract for this skill. Do not duplicate step sequence, gate conditions, state transitions,
or failure-recovery procedures here.

## Codex-skill notes

### (1) Invocation surface

- Triggered via `$track-pr-review` in a Codex skill mention surface.
- Can also be force-loaded with `codex exec` by referencing this skill file.

### (2) Sandbox constraint

- Requires `--sandbox workspace-write`: the workflow pushes the branch to origin and
  interacts with the GitHub API via `gh` / `bin/sotp pr` wrappers.
- Branch push uses `bin/sotp pr push`; PR creation uses `bin/sotp pr ensure-pr`.
- Do not run `git push` directly.

### (3) Sub-workflow and capability invocation

- PR creation and push are performed via `bin/sotp pr push` and `bin/sotp pr ensure-pr`.
- PR-level review is triggered via `bin/sotp pr review-cycle` (which dispatches `@codex review`).
- Codex-specific prerequisite: the **Codex Cloud GitHub App** must be installed on the
  repository so `@codex review` is acted upon.

### (4) Finding fixes are delegated

- Follow Step 3 of the workflow SSoT for the finding-fix procedure (briefing contents,
  capability routing, local convergence, commit, re-run, recovery). Codex-specific dispatch
  forms only:
  - implementer-owned corrections (source and every non-ADR artifact not owned by a phase
    writer — policies, documentation, harness configuration, settings, manifests, build files):
    `bin/sotp capability exec implementer --briefing-file <path>` with `--host` omitted, so
    the dispatcher runs the provider subprocess itself (dispatcher-owned sandbox / model /
    effort flags); never pass `--host codex` and never hand-assemble a `codex exec` command.
  - writer-owned artifacts go to their phase writers through phase entry, as the workflow SSoT
    routes them: prepare the configured briefing, then `bin/sotp phase enter spec-design`
    (`spec.json` and its view), `bin/sotp phase enter type-design` (`<layer>-types.json` and
    its views), or `bin/sotp phase enter impl-plan` (`impl-plan.json`, `task-coverage.json`,
    `task-contract.json`, `batch-plan.json`).
- Do not route a focused PR finding through `cargo make track-local-review-fix`: that
  wrapper always injects the scope-wide reviewer loop and is not a delegated-PR-finding
  transport.
- local convergence and commit use `$track-review` and `$track-commit`.

### (5) Reporting format

- On an explicit zero-findings terminal signal per the workflow SSoT, print:
  `PR_REVIEW_STATUS: completed — PR <url> machine PASS — zero findings`
- On an Accepted Deviations exception explicitly approved by the user per the workflow SSoT,
  print: `PR_REVIEW_STATUS: completed — PR <url> user-approved Accepted Deviations — not zero findings`
  Include the user's approval citation; reviewer approval alone is not user approval.
- On failure or block, print: `PR_REVIEW_STATUS: blocked — <reason>`
