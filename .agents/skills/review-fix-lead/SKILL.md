# Review-Fix-Lead (Codex) Skill

**Operational SSoT:** read and follow `.harness/capabilities/review-fix-lead.md` — the
provider-agnostic contract for this capability. Do not duplicate it here.

## Codex-skill notes

- Invoked when Codex is assigned the `review-fix-lead` capability.
- For file inspection, use `cat` / `grep` / `rg` shell idioms.
- The final line of your output MUST be exactly one of:
  `REVIEW_FIX_STATUS: completed` / `REVIEW_FIX_STATUS: blocked_cross_scope` /
  `REVIEW_FIX_STATUS: failed`.

## Session resume conformance

- If your dispatch is a resumed session (orchestrator opt-in continuation), follow the
  "Session resume" section of the capability SSoT: check whether your upstream artifacts
  changed since the prior session and re-read any that did before continuing.
