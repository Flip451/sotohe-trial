# Track-Commit (Codex skill)

**Operational SSoT:** read and follow `.harness/workflows/track/commit.md` — the provider-agnostic
workflow contract for this skill. Do not duplicate step sequence, gate conditions, state transitions,
or failure-recovery procedures here.

## Codex-skill notes

### (1) Invocation surface

- Triggered via `$track-commit` in a Codex skill mention surface.
- Can also be force-loaded with `codex exec` by referencing this skill file.

### (2) Sandbox constraint

- Requires `--sandbox workspace-write`: the workflow stages files and creates a commit.
- Staging is done via `bin/sotp git add-from-file tmp/track-commit/add-paths.txt --cleanup`
  (writing paths to `tmp/track-commit/add-paths.txt` first) or `bin/sotp git add-all`.
- Commit creation uses `cargo make track-commit-message` exclusively.
- Do not run `git add` / `git commit` / `git push` directly.

The workflow SSoT owns commit inputs, preconditions, gate waiting, failure recovery, and note
timing; this adapter only supplies the Codex command and tool constraints above.

### (3) Reporting format

- On successful completion, print: `COMMIT_STATUS: completed — <short-hash> <subject>`
- On failure or block, print: `COMMIT_STATUS: blocked — <reason>`
